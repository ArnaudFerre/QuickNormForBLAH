The possibility, in principle, for some strains to lose only a part of their virulence cassette (gene vct), while retaining its proximal part has been shown. In most cases such strains are isolated from patients with diarrhea of different severity and may probably play some etiological role, provided that the expression of the genes of additional toxins of the virulence cassette occurs. The gene expressing neuraminidase which facilitates the penetration of cholera toxin into the epithelial cells of the intestine is always present in vct+ strains and may be absent in vct- strains. The absence of genetic relationship between neuraminidases in V. cholerae O139 and V. cholerae O1 and non-O1 (non-O139) has been confirmed. The problems in connection with the integration and deletion of genetic determinants of V. cholerae virulence factors are discussed.\n\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 113}, "obj": "Title"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 43, "end": 58}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 59, "end": 68}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 114, "end": 125}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 114, "end": 1250}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 244, "end": 253}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 468, "end": 477}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 594, "end": 638}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 754, "end": 763}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 875, "end": 885}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 875, "end": 908}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 899, "end": 908}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 1040, "end": 1056}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T14-0", "span": {"begin": 1061, "end": 1072}, "obj": "_FRAGMENT"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 1061, "end": 1075}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T14-1", "span": {"begin": 1080, "end": 1097}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 1206, "end": 1217}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 1218, "end": 1227}, "obj": "Phenotype"}], "relations": [{"id": "C-T14-0", "pred": "_lexicallyChainedTo", "subj": "T14-1", "obj": "T14-0"}]}
