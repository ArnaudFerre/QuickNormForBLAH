Specific detection of this microorganism could be of interest to the dairy industry. We also note that Propionibacterium freudenreichii\n was rapidly identified in Leerdamer cheese by DGGE; this microorganism \nis particularly difficult to cultivate on artificial medium and requires\n an incubation time of at least 7 days. Unexpectedly, we identified Pseudoalteromonas species and Halomonas\n species by sequencing two unassigned bands found in the Epoisses cheese\n profiles. This is the first time that these two salt-tolerant bacterial\n species are found in dairy products; their identification was enabled \nby molecular methods.\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 181, "end": 203}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 217, "end": 231}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 238, "end": 256}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 257, "end": 270}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 426, "end": 440}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 460, "end": 492}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 520, "end": 536}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 608, "end": 625}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 707, "end": 724}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 737, "end": 746}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 804, "end": 819}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 869, "end": 882}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 915, "end": 929}, "obj": "Habitat"}]}
