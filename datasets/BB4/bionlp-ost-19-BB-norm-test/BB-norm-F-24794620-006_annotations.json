In cheese rinds from facility B, OTU 1 (H. boliviensis) and OTU 7 (B. conglomeratum) were significantly increased compared to the other facilities (1.5 and 2.7 fold change), whereas the 18S rRNA OTU 1 (Scopulariopsis brevicaulis) decreased significantly by 2.8 fold and OTU 2 (Pyxidiophora arvernensis) increased significantly (3.3 fold change). 16S rRNA gene libraries showed OTU 5 (A. kashmirensis) and 18S rRNA gene libraries showed OTU 4 (Nectria mariannaeae) to have increased significantly in facility C (10.4 and 6.5 fold change) ( Fig. 4, Supplementary Table S5 and S6).\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 56, "end": 62}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 56, "end": 85}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 136, "end": 150}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 163, "end": 186}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 222, "end": 233}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 311, "end": 317}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 311, "end": 339}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 348, "end": 362}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 375, "end": 391}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 510, "end": 536}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 585, "end": 609}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 692, "end": 707}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 751, "end": 770}, "obj": "Microorganism"}]}
