Anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria that contribute substantially to the release of fixed nitrogen into the atmosphere use the oxidizing power of NO to activate inert ammonium into hydrazine (N2H4). Here, we describe an enzyme from the anammox bacterium Kuenenia stuttgartiensis that uses a novel pathway to make NO from hydroxylamine. This new enzyme is related to octaheme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase, a key protein in aerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria. By a multiphasic approach including the determination of the crystal structure of the K. stuttgartiensis enzyme at 1.8 \u212b resolution and refinement and reassessment of the hydroxylamine oxidoreductase structure from Nitrosomonas europaea, both in the presence and absence of their substrates, we propose a model for NO formation by the K. stuttgartiensis enzyme. Our results expand the understanding of the functions that the widespread family of octaheme proteins have. \n\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 73}, "obj": "Title"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 74, "end": 1142}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 202, "end": 211}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 202, "end": 230}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 212, "end": 230}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 232, "end": 239}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 450, "end": 457}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 468, "end": 492}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 636, "end": 643}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 644, "end": 662}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 759, "end": 777}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 888, "end": 909}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 1008, "end": 1026}, "obj": "Microorganism"}]}
