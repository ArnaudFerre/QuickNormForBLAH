Because a two-step enrichment was used, the detection limit for dead S. enterica cells in artificially contaminated ice cream and salami samples was high at 10(7 )CFU (25 g)(-1), eliminating potential false-positive results. When the method was evaluated with a range of 100 naturally contaminated food samples, three positive samples were detected by both the real-time PCR-based method and by the standard microbiological method, according to EN ISO 6579. When the real-time PCR-based method was evaluated alongside the standard microbiological method according to EN ISO 6579 with 36 food samples artificially contaminated at a level of 10(0 )CFU (25 g)(-1), identical results were obtained from both methods.\nThe real-time PCR-based method involving a two-step enrichment produced equivalent results to EN ISO 6579 on the day after sample receipt.\nThe developed method is suitable for rapid detection of S. enterica in food.\n\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 107}, "obj": "Title"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 13, "end": 32}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 36, "end": 40}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 108, "end": 226}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 198, "end": 217}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 221, "end": 225}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 227, "end": 1229}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 313, "end": 335}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 360, "end": 388}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 421, "end": 431}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 586, "end": 597}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T15-0", "span": {"begin": 607, "end": 632}, "obj": "_FRAGMENT"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 607, "end": 642}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T15-1", "span": {"begin": 647, "end": 661}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 792, "end": 827}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 1104, "end": 1142}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 1230, "end": 1368}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 1369, "end": 1445}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 1425, "end": 1436}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 1440, "end": 1444}, "obj": "Habitat"}], "relations": [{"id": "C-T15-0", "pred": "_lexicallyChainedTo", "subj": "T15-1", "obj": "T15-0"}]}
