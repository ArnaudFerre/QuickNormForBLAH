The severity of CP was based on the investigation of probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL). The definition and stage of CKD were based on the criteria proposed by the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative of the National Kidney Foundation. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using the equation of Modification of Diet in Renal Disease and the identification of microorganisms in subgingival plaque was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\nCandida albicans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola were more common in patients who were on RRT and pre-dialysis than in control subjects. CP was more severe in patients with CKD. A strong association was observed between the frequency of C. albicans (P = 0.056), P.gingivalis (P = 0.008), T. denticola (P = 0.013) and CAL, when CKD patients were compared with the control group.\nCP is more severe and is associated with increased frequency of C. albicans, P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and T. denticola in patients with CKD.\n\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 122}, "obj": "Title"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 18, "end": 29}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 18, "end": 39}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T9-0", "span": {"begin": 73, "end": 81}, "obj": "_FRAGMENT"}, {"id": "T8-0", "span": {"begin": 73, "end": 86}, "obj": "_FRAGMENT"}, {"id": "T9-1", "span": {"begin": 91, "end": 121}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T8-1", "span": {"begin": 99, "end": 121}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 107, "end": 113}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 123, "end": 376}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 140, "end": 175}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 223, "end": 234}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 223, "end": 244}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 259, "end": 295}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 281, "end": 287}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 339, "end": 350}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 377, "end": 1124}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 386, "end": 402}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 441, "end": 454}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 460, "end": 484}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 522, "end": 540}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 550, "end": 574}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 587, "end": 592}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T23", "span": {"begin": 614, "end": 623}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T24", "span": {"begin": 1053, "end": 1071}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T25", "span": {"begin": 1125, "end": 1141}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 1125, "end": 1543}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T26", "span": {"begin": 1143, "end": 1167}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T27", "span": {"begin": 1169, "end": 1189}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T28", "span": {"begin": 1195, "end": 1214}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T29", "span": {"begin": 1235, "end": 1243}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T30", "span": {"begin": 1285, "end": 1301}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T31", "span": {"begin": 1325, "end": 1342}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T32", "span": {"begin": 1403, "end": 1414}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T33", "span": {"begin": 1428, "end": 1440}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T34", "span": {"begin": 1454, "end": 1466}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T35", "span": {"begin": 1493, "end": 1505}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T36", "span": {"begin": 1529, "end": 1542}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 1544, "end": 1688}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T37", "span": {"begin": 1608, "end": 1619}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T38", "span": {"begin": 1621, "end": 1634}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T39", "span": {"begin": 1636, "end": 1648}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T40", "span": {"begin": 1654, "end": 1666}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T41", "span": {"begin": 1670, "end": 1687}, "obj": "Habitat"}], "relations": [{"id": "C-T8-0", "pred": "_lexicallyChainedTo", "subj": "T8-1", "obj": "T8-0"}, {"id": "C-T9-0", "pred": "_lexicallyChainedTo", "subj": "T9-1", "obj": "T9-0"}]}
