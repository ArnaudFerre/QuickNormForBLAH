The ability of a strain to produce EPS is not \ndirectly correlated to its ability to reside in beer but probably has \nimportance in biofilm formation [12], thereby enabling persistence in the brewery environment. The EPS produced by P. claussenii ATCC BAA-344T is a high-molecular-mass \u03b2-glucan produced by the action of a transmembrane glycosyl transferase (gtf) gene. This gene is located on plasmid pPECL-7, which is not essential for growth in beer [21].\n The fibrillar polymer consists of a trisaccharide repeating unit with a\n \u03b2-1,3-linked glucose backbone and branches made up of single \n\u03b2-1,2-linked D-glucopyranosyl residues. Walling and colleagues [33] reported a glucosyl transferase gene (dps) in P. damnosus\n IOEB8801, originating from wine, that produces a linear backbone of \n3-\u03b2-D-glucose-1 moieties.\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 10}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 38, "end": 60}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T3-0", "span": {"begin": 79, "end": 86}, "obj": "_FRAGMENT"}, {"id": "T3-1", "span": {"begin": 99, "end": 113}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 170, "end": 174}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 207, "end": 214}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 207, "end": 224}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 267, "end": 274}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 308, "end": 335}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 523, "end": 527}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 784, "end": 805}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 824, "end": 828}, "obj": "Habitat"}], "relations": [{"id": "C-T3-0", "pred": "_lexicallyChainedTo", "subj": "T3-1", "obj": "T3-0"}]}
