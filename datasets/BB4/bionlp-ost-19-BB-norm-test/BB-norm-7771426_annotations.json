Four weeks after treatment withdrawal, cure of H. pylori infection was evaluated by rapid urease test and histology.\nOne hundred and sixteen patients returned for follow-up. In 108 patients, H. pylori could not be identified 4 wk after cessation of therapy. The eradication rate was calculated to 93%. In addition, all patients with active peptic ulcers showed complete healing at follow-up despite no further treatment. Drug acceptance and compliance was excellent.\nTriple therapy as suggested by Bazzoli with omeprazole (in this study given b.i.d. for better compliance), clarythromycin, and tinidazole is indeed highly effective for both cure of H. pylori infection and for healing of peptic ulcers, is easy to perform, is cheap, and is without clinically significant side effects, even in a larger population.\n\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 107}, "obj": "Title"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 48, "end": 67}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 93, "end": 106}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 108, "end": 312}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 233, "end": 252}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 313, "end": 705}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T11-0", "span": {"begin": 351, "end": 364}, "obj": "_FRAGMENT"}, {"id": "T10-0", "span": {"begin": 351, "end": 364}, "obj": "_FRAGMENT"}, {"id": "T9-0", "span": {"begin": 351, "end": 371}, "obj": "_FRAGMENT"}, {"id": "T11-1", "span": {"begin": 384, "end": 390}, "obj": "_FRAGMENT"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 400, "end": 412}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T9-1", "span": {"begin": 400, "end": 420}, "obj": "_FRAGMENT"}, {"id": "T11-2", "span": {"begin": 400, "end": 420}, "obj": "_FRAGMENT"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 424, "end": 429}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T10-1", "span": {"begin": 424, "end": 444}, "obj": "_FRAGMENT"}, {"id": "T9-2", "span": {"begin": 454, "end": 477}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T11-3", "span": {"begin": 454, "end": 477}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T10-2", "span": {"begin": 454, "end": 477}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 458, "end": 467}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 636, "end": 645}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 706, "end": 1055}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 730, "end": 738}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 770, "end": 778}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 780, "end": 789}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 908, "end": 942}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 922, "end": 942}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 1056, "end": 1402}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 1238, "end": 1247}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 1277, "end": 1290}, "obj": "Habitat"}], "relations": [{"id": "C-T10-0", "pred": "_lexicallyChainedTo", "subj": "T10-1", "obj": "T10-0"}, {"id": "C-T10-1", "pred": "_lexicallyChainedTo", "subj": "T10-2", "obj": "T10-1"}, {"id": "C-T11-0", "pred": "_lexicallyChainedTo", "subj": "T11-1", "obj": "T11-0"}, {"id": "C-T11-1", "pred": "_lexicallyChainedTo", "subj": "T11-2", "obj": "T11-1"}, {"id": "C-T11-2", "pred": "_lexicallyChainedTo", "subj": "T11-3", "obj": "T11-2"}, {"id": "C-T9-0", "pred": "_lexicallyChainedTo", "subj": "T9-1", "obj": "T9-0"}, {"id": "C-T9-1", "pred": "_lexicallyChainedTo", "subj": "T9-2", "obj": "T9-1"}]}
