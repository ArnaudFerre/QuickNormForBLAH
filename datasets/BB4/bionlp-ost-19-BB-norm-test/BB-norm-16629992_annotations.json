Bacterial genomic DNA templates were prepared by hot lysis in a lysis buffer. Amplification of the specific gene segments was carried out at 65 degrees C for 1 h. The amplified gene products were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis and detected by staining gels with ethidium bromide. A PCR assay was also included in this study. Our results demonstrate that the ladder-like pattern of bands from 204 bp specific to the Fl. columnare 16S ribosomal RNA gene was amplified. The detection limit of the LAMP assay was comparable to that of PCR in prepared genomic DNA reactions. In addition, this optimized LAMP assay was able to detect the Fl. columnare 16S ribosomal RNA gene in experimentally infected channel catfish.\nThe LAMP assay for Fl. columnare detection in channel catfish was established.\nBecause LAMP assay is a rapid, sensitive, specific, simple and cost-effective assay for Fl. columnare detection in channel catfish, it is useful for rapid diagnosis of Fl. columnare in fish hatcheries and the field.\n\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 148}, "obj": "Title"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 57}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 61, "end": 68}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 61, "end": 76}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 77, "end": 96}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 149, "end": 388}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 241, "end": 265}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 351, "end": 358}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 351, "end": 366}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 368, "end": 387}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 389, "end": 1239}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 508, "end": 516}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 942, "end": 955}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 1159, "end": 1172}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 1199, "end": 1238}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 1223, "end": 1230}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 1240, "end": 1318}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 1259, "end": 1272}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 1286, "end": 1293}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 1286, "end": 1301}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 1319, "end": 1534}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 1407, "end": 1420}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T23", "span": {"begin": 1434, "end": 1441}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T24", "span": {"begin": 1434, "end": 1449}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T25", "span": {"begin": 1487, "end": 1500}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T27", "span": {"begin": 1504, "end": 1508}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T26", "span": {"begin": 1504, "end": 1519}, "obj": "Habitat"}]}
