The populations in both cities were similar in ethnic background, socioeconomic status, family size, and access to medical care. Significant differences in nasopharyngeal colonization rates, in serotypes causing infections, and in antibiotic resistance were found between the two cities. In children 0 to 2 years of age, 42% were colonized with S. pneumoniae in Santiago compared to 14% in Temuco. A total of 41 serotypes were identified in both Chilean cities studied. Six serotypes were found only in Santiago; 14 serotypes were found only in Temuco. Antibiotic-resistant serotypes 6A, 6B, 14, 19F, and 23F were detected only in Santiago. We show that important differences in the incidence of nasopharyngeal carriage, infection, and S. pneumoniae serotypes can exist in similar populations in different areas of the same country. Our findings are relevant for prevention strategies, antibiotic usage, and vaccine design.\n\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 103}, "obj": "Title"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 22, "end": 43}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 47, "end": 71}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 88, "end": 102}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 104, "end": 1344}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 133, "end": 147}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 164, "end": 188}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 212, "end": 219}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 251, "end": 272}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 293, "end": 335}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 320, "end": 335}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 340, "end": 375}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 359, "end": 375}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 383, "end": 397}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T15", "span": {"begin": 445, "end": 451}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T16", "span": {"begin": 577, "end": 591}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T17", "span": {"begin": 652, "end": 673}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T18", "span": {"begin": 701, "end": 707}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T19", "span": {"begin": 712, "end": 740}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T20", "span": {"begin": 766, "end": 779}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T21", "span": {"begin": 867, "end": 881}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T22", "span": {"begin": 974, "end": 994}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T23", "span": {"begin": 1005, "end": 1007}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T24", "span": {"begin": 1009, "end": 1011}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T25", "span": {"begin": 1013, "end": 1015}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T26", "span": {"begin": 1017, "end": 1020}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T27", "span": {"begin": 1026, "end": 1029}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T28", "span": {"begin": 1117, "end": 1131}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T29", "span": {"begin": 1157, "end": 1170}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T30", "span": {"begin": 1329, "end": 1336}, "obj": "Habitat"}]}
