The adherence capacity of probiotic bacteria to the GI tract\n is a contributing factor for pathogen exclusion [5] and the cell surface characteristics of probiotic bacteria have been related to these adhesion properties [6-9]. Several members of the genus Lactobacillus\n are capable of producing exopolysaccharides (EPS) which can play an \nessential role in determining the cell surface characteristics [7]. EPS are also involved in the formation of biofilms [10,11], which may improve colonisation and aid survival [12-14].\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 30}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 85, "end": 108}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 119, "end": 128}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 132, "end": 139}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 234, "end": 252}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 256, "end": 265}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 282, "end": 290}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 321, "end": 329}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 384, "end": 393}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T10", "span": {"begin": 430, "end": 449}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T11", "span": {"begin": 486, "end": 499}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T12", "span": {"begin": 505, "end": 544}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T13", "span": {"begin": 667, "end": 688}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T14", "span": {"begin": 680, "end": 688}, "obj": "Habitat"}]}
