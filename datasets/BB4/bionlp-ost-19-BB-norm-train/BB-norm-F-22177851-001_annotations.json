However, when it \nwas inoculated at a high level, the bacterial biodiversity was \ndrastically lowered from day 25 to the end of ripening. Overall, the \npresence of P. celer led to the higher production of volatile \naroma compounds such as aldehydes, ketones and sulfur compounds. \nRegardless of its inoculation level, H. alvei barely affected \nthe growth of the bacterial community and was subdominant at the end of \nripening. It influenced total volatile aroma compound production with \nvolatile sulfur compounds being the most abundant.\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 20, "end": 28}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 73, "end": 79}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 282, "end": 290}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 436, "end": 444}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 480, "end": 499}, "obj": "Habitat"}], "attributes": [{"id": "A5", "pred": "OntoBiotope", "subj": "T5", "obj": "OBT:000113"}, {"id": "A2", "pred": "OntoBiotope", "subj": "T2", "obj": "OBT:001480"}, {"id": "A1", "pred": "NCBI_Taxonomy", "subj": "T1", "obj": "306572"}, {"id": "A3", "pred": "NCBI_Taxonomy", "subj": "T3", "obj": "306572"}, {"id": "A4", "pred": "NCBI_Taxonomy", "subj": "T4", "obj": "569"}]}
