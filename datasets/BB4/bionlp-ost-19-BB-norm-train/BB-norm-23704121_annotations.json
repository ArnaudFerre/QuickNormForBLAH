An economic analysis.\nIn May 2011, the Food and Drug Administration approved fidaxomicin for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). It has been found to be noninferior to vancomycin; however, its cost-effectiveness for the treatment of CDI remains undetermined.\nWe developed a decision analytic simulation model to determine the economic value of fidaxomicin for CDI treatment from the third-party payer perspective. We looked at CDI treatment in these 3 cases: (1) no fidaxomicin, (2) only fidaxomicin, and (3) fidaxomicin based on strain typing results.\nThe incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for fidaxomicin based on screening given current conditions was >$43.7 million per quality-adjusted life-year and using only fidaxomicin was dominated (ie, more costly and less effective) by the other 2 treatment strategies explored. The fidaxomicin strategy tended to remain dominated, even at lower costs. With approximately 50% of CDI due to the NAP1/BI/027 strain, a course of fidaxomicin would need to cost \u2264$150 to be cost-effective in the treatment of all CDI cases and between $160 and $400 to be cost-effective for those with a non-NAP1/BI/027 strain (ie, treatment based on strain typing).\nGiven the current cost and NAP1/BI/027 accounting for approximately 50% of isolates, using fidaxomicin as a first-line treatment for CDI is not cost-effective. However, typing and treatment with fidaxomicin based on strain may be more promising depending on the costs of fidaxomicin.\n\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 52}, "obj": "Title"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 53, "end": 309}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 141, "end": 162}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 310, "end": 603}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 604, "end": 1244}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 1245, "end": 1528}, "obj": "Paragraph"}], "attributes": [{"id": "A1", "pred": "NCBI_Taxonomy", "subj": "T6", "obj": "1496"}]}
