Genomic and proteomic studies have identified three genes, pa0102, pa2053 and pa4676, in P. aeruginosa PAO1 encoding three functional \u03b2-carbonic anhydrases (\u03b2-CAs): psCA1, psCA2 and psCA3, respectively. These \u03b2-CAs could serve as novel antimicrobial drug targets for this pathogen. X-ray crystallographic structural studies have been initiated to characterize the structure and function of these proteins. This communication describes the production of two crystal forms (A and B) of \u03b2-CA psCA3. Form A diffracted to a resolution of 2.9 \u00c5; it belonged to space group P212121, with unit-cell parameters a = 81.9, b = 84.9, c = 124.2 \u00c5, and had a calculated Matthews coefficient of 2.23 \u00c5\u00b3 Da\u207b\u00b9 assuming four molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Form B diffracted to a resolution of 3.0 \u00c5; it belonged to space group P21212, with unit-cell parameters a = 69.9, b = 77.7, c = 88.5 \u00c5, and had a calculated Matthews coefficient of 2.48 \u00c5\u00b3 Da\u207b\u00b9 assuming two molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Preliminary molecular-replacement solutions have been determined with the PHENIX AutoMR wizard and refinement of both crystal forms is currently in progress.\n\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 102}, "obj": "Title"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 79, "end": 101}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 103, "end": 125}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 103, "end": 1458}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 131, "end": 144}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 198, "end": 221}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 229, "end": 282}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 373, "end": 391}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 556, "end": 564}, "obj": "Phenotype"}], "attributes": [{"id": "A6", "pred": "NCBI_Taxonomy", "subj": "T8", "obj": "208964"}, {"id": "A1", "pred": "NCBI_Taxonomy", "subj": "T3", "obj": "287"}, {"id": "A7", "pred": "OntoBiotope", "subj": "T9", "obj": "OBT:002806"}, {"id": "A5", "pred": "OntoBiotope", "subj": "T7", "obj": "OBT:002337"}, {"id": "A3", "pred": "OntoBiotope", "subj": "T5", "obj": "OBT:000648"}, {"id": "A4", "pred": "OntoBiotope", "subj": "T6", "obj": "OBT:002488"}, {"id": "A2", "pred": "NCBI_Taxonomy", "subj": "T4", "obj": "287"}]}
