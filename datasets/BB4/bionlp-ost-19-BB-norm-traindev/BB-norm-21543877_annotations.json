Aminoglycoside antibiotics have become less effective in recent years owing to antibiotic resistance, which arises primarily through enzymatic modification of the antibiotics. The gene product Rv3168, a putative aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (APH), from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was crystallized using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method in the presence of 0.2 M calcium acetate, 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.0 and 20% PEG 3000 at 295 K. X-ray diffraction data were collected to a maximum resolution of 1.67 \u00c5 on a synchrotron beamline. The crystal belonged to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 56.74, b = 62.37, c = 103.61 \u00c5. With one molecule per asymmetric unit, the crystal volume per unit protein weight (V(M)) is 2.91 \u00c5(3) Da(-1). The structure was solved by the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method and refinement of the selenomethionine structure is in progress.\n\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-dev", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 135}, "obj": "Title"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 102, "end": 134}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 136, "end": 1163}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 218, "end": 234}, "obj": "Habitat"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 338, "end": 359}, "obj": "Phenotype"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 517, "end": 543}, "obj": "Microorganism"}], "attributes": [{"id": "A4", "pred": "NCBI_Taxonomy", "subj": "T6", "obj": "83332"}, {"id": "A2", "pred": "OntoBiotope", "subj": "T4", "obj": "OBT:002488"}, {"id": "A1", "pred": "NCBI_Taxonomy", "subj": "T3", "obj": "83332"}, {"id": "A3", "pred": "OntoBiotope", "subj": "T5", "obj": "OBT:002674"}]}
