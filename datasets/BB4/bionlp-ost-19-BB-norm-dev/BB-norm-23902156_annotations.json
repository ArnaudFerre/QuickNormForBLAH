A homolog protein was isolated and characterized from Penicillium crustosum which is not known to be allergenic mold. A cDNA library of P. crustosum was constructed and screened using a probe based on the DNA sequence of Pen b 26. A positive clone was isolated, expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and characterized by comparing its immunological and physical properties to Pen b 26. It was designated as Pen cr 26 and had a 321 nt ORF corresponding to 107 amino acids with a MW of 11\u2009kDa. Pen cr 26 had strong sequence homology to Pen b 26 (92% for nucleotides and 86% for amino acids) and its physical and predicted structural properties were similar to the latter. The level of expression of Pen cr 26 was much lower than that of Pen b 26 in the same expression vector. Both proteins were recognized equally well by the IgG class specific antibodies, but Pen cr 26 was poorly recognized by Penicillium-sensitive atopic sera (IgE), suggesting striking antigenic difference in IgE epitopes, i.e., 87% were positive for Pen b 26 while only 23% were positive for Pen cr 26. The allergenicity of Pen cr 26 seems to be minor in nature and it could be a hypoallergenic variant of Pen b 26. \n\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-dev", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 90}, "obj": "Title"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 68, "end": 89}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 91, "end": 1393}, "obj": "Paragraph"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 129, "end": 155}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 258, "end": 279}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 340, "end": 352}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 479, "end": 495}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 1101, "end": 1112}, "obj": "Microorganism"}, {"id": "T9", "span": {"begin": 1101, "end": 1134}, "obj": "Habitat"}], "attributes": [{"id": "A5", "pred": "NCBI_Taxonomy", "subj": "T7", "obj": "562"}, {"id": "A4", "pred": "NCBI_Taxonomy", "subj": "T6", "obj": "36656"}, {"id": "A6", "pred": "OntoBiotope", "subj": "T9", "obj": "OBT:000007"}, {"id": "A7", "pred": "NCBI_Taxonomy", "subj": "T8", "obj": "5073"}, {"id": "A2", "pred": "NCBI_Taxonomy", "subj": "T4", "obj": "5074"}, {"id": "A1", "pred": "NCBI_Taxonomy", "subj": "T3", "obj": "36656"}, {"id": "A3", "pred": "NCBI_Taxonomy", "subj": "T5", "obj": "36656"}]}
