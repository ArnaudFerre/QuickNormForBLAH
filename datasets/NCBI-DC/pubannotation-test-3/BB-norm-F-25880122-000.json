It proved to be capable of growing in \nbeer, thereby resisting this environment, which is unfavorable for \nmicrobial growth. The molecular mechanisms underlying its metabolic \ncapabilities and niche adaptations were unknown up to now. In the \npresent study, whole-genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis \nwere used to investigate this strain\u2019s mechanisms to reside in the beer \nniche, with special focus on not only stress and hop resistances but \nalso folate biosynthesis and exopolysaccharide (EPS) production.\n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [], "attributes": []}
