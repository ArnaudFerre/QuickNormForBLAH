For some time the occurrence of Halomonas in dairy products was a matter for controversial discussion. Halomonas was suggested to be an indicator for hygienic deficiencies in cheese producing facilities ( Maoz et al., 2003),\n while it has also been suggested that these bacteria, which originally \noriginate in marine environments, are added via sea salt to cheese \nsurfaces during washing and dry salting (Ishikawa et al., 2007). The dominance of Halomonas\n in short-ripened cheese rinds is most likely due to more frequent \nwashing with a higher brine concentration. The high abundance of Halomonas\n in VB cheese rinds suggests an important function during cheese \nripening, particularly of young cheese. However, it is still unknown \nwhether Halomonas contributes to the flavor or texture of VB or other cheeses.Coryneform bacteria including Brevibacterium spp., Corynebacterium spp., Arthrobacter spp., Microbacterium spp. and Brachybacterium\n spp. are important for cheese ripening due to their proteolytic \nactivity and because they produce volatile sulfur compounds or ammonia (\n Eliskases-Lechner and Ginzinger, 1995). Similarly to other studies ( Dolci et al., 2009, Feurer et al., 2004b, Gori et al., 2013, Maoz et al., 2003, Mounier et al., 2005 and Rea et al., 2007), we found a high diversity and abundance of coryneforms (13 OTUs, 149 out of 408 clones) in VB cheese rinds.B. linens\n is an important flavor producer and responsible for the development of \nthe typical red pigmentation of red-smear cheeses, which result from the\n production of a red carotenoid. It has been described as the most \ncommon organism on cheese surfaces ( Eliskases-Lechner and Ginzinger, 1995 and Rattray and Fox, 1999).\n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [], "attributes": []}
