The adherence capacity of probiotic bacteria to the GI tract\n is a contributing factor for pathogen exclusion [5] and the cell surface characteristics of probiotic bacteria have been related to these adhesion properties [6-9]. Several members of the genus Lactobacillus\n are capable of producing exopolysaccharides (EPS) which can play an \nessential role in determining the cell surface characteristics [7]. EPS are also involved in the formation of biofilms [10,11], which may improve colonisation and aid survival [12-14].\n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [], "attributes": []}
