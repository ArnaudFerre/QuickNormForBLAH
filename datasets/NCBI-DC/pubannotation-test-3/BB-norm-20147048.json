Sterilized plant tissue is cocultivated with an A. tumefaciens suspension, transformants are selected and the shoots are grown in rooting medium and then in soil. Plant phenotypes can be examined approximately 3 mo after transfer of plants to soil.\n\n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [], "attributes": []}
