The ability of a strain to produce EPS is not \ndirectly correlated to its ability to reside in beer but probably has \nimportance in biofilm formation [12], thereby enabling persistence in the brewery environment. The EPS produced by P. claussenii ATCC BAA-344T is a high-molecular-mass \u03b2-glucan produced by the action of a transmembrane glycosyl transferase (gtf) gene. This gene is located on plasmid pPECL-7, which is not essential for growth in beer [21].\n The fibrillar polymer consists of a trisaccharide repeating unit with a\n \u03b2-1,3-linked glucose backbone and branches made up of single \n\u03b2-1,2-linked D-glucopyranosyl residues. Walling and colleagues [33] reported a glucosyl transferase gene (dps) in P. damnosus\n IOEB8801, originating from wine, that produces a linear backbone of \n3-\u03b2-D-glucose-1 moieties.\n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [], "attributes": []}
