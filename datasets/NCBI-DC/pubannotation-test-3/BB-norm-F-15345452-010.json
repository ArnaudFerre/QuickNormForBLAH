No differences were seen in \nTTGE patterns between samples originating from the same part of the \ncheese. However, TTGE patterns revealed differences in bacterial \ncomposition between the cheese core and cheese surface. The cheese core \nwas generally inhabited by various LAB (Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Streptococcus thermophilus), whereas the cheese surface was generally inhabited by staphylococci and gram-negative bacteria (Moraxella bovis and Pseudomonas sp.).\n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [], "attributes": []}
