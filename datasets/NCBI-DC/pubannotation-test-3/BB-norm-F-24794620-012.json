S. equorum\n may contribute to the aromatic characteristics and the orange pigments \nof cheeses as a result of the production of extracellular proteolytic \nand lipolytic enzymes. Staphylococci have been reported to produce \nantibacterial substances, e.g. S. equorum strain WS 2733 produces a peptide antibiotic (macrococcin P1) on the surface of Raclette cheese, which inhibits the growth of L. monocytogenes ( Carnio et al., 2000). We detected a significant increase of S. equorum (OTU 3) in long-ripened cheese rinds of all facilities as well as in younger cheeses of ripening cellar A1.\n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [], "attributes": []}
