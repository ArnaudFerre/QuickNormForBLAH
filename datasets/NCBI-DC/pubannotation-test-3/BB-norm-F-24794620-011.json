In \naddition, weaker (r > 0.6) negative correlations of OTU 2 with \nOTU 16 (Pusillimonas) and OTU 20 (Leucobacter) were found in cellars C2 and C1.Corynebacterium casei and C. variabile have been shown to be dominant on Danish surface-ripened cheeses ( Gori et al., 2013). The presence of C. glutamicum\n on Fontina cheese rinds has been confirmed and the species has been \nsuggested to be among the most important ripening bacteria, increasing \nin abundance towards the end of ripening ( Dolci et al., 2009 and Dolci et al., 2013). Brine, personnel, and equipment have been suggested as possible sources for Corynebacterium ( Brennan et al., 2002).\n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [], "attributes": []}
