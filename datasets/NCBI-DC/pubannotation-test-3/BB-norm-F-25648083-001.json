We also tested microaerobic and anaerobic conditions, \nwhich would be encountered in the GI tract, and found that oxygen \nlimitation did not affect the biofilm formation on sterile microscope \nslide surfaces (data not shown). Biofilm formation was also seen in \npolystyrene 96 well plates using crystal violet, and this method was \nselected to measure variations in biofilms between wild type and mutant \nstrains to investigate the effect of EPS production on biofilm formation\n (Figure 2). Comparison of L. johnsonii FI9785 with the well-known probiotic strain L. rhamnosus\n GG indicated that biofilm formation of these two strains was quite \nsimilar.\n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [], "attributes": []}
