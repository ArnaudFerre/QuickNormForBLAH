Specific detection of this microorganism could be of interest to the dairy industry. We also note that Propionibacterium freudenreichii\n was rapidly identified in Leerdamer cheese by DGGE; this microorganism \nis particularly difficult to cultivate on artificial medium and requires\n an incubation time of at least 7 days. Unexpectedly, we identified Pseudoalteromonas species and Halomonas\n species by sequencing two unassigned bands found in the Epoisses cheese\n profiles. This is the first time that these two salt-tolerant bacterial\n species are found in dairy products; their identification was enabled \nby molecular methods.\n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [], "attributes": []}
