The rare diseases ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), caused by mutations in the ATM gene, and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), with mutations in the p95/nbs1 gene, share a variety of phenotypic abnormalities such as chromosomal instability, radiation sensitivity and defects in cell-cycle checkpoints in response to ionizing radiation. The ATM gene encodes a protein kinase that is activated by ionizing radiation or radiomimetic drugs, whereas p95/nbs1 is part of a protein complex that is involved in responses to DNA double-strand breaks. Here, because of the similarities between AT and NBS, we evaluated the functional interactions between ATM and p95/nbs1. Activation of the ATM kinase by ionizing radiation and induction of ATM-dependent responses in NBS cells indicated that p95/nbs1 may not be required for signalling to ATM after ionizing radiation. However, p95/nbs1 was phosphorylated on serine 343 in an ATM-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo after ionizing radiation. A p95/nbs1 construct mutated at the ATM phosphorylation site abrogated an S-phase checkpoint induced by ionizing radiation in normal cells and failed to compensate for this functional deficiency in NBS cells. These observations link ATM and p95/nbs1 in a common signalling pathway and provide an explanation for phenotypic similarities in these two diseases.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 66, "end": 79}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 80, "end": 101}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 103, "end": 105}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 149, "end": 175}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 177, "end": 180}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 239, "end": 263}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 272, "end": 295}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 640, "end": 642}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 647, "end": 650}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 814, "end": 817}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1239, "end": 1242}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D035583"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D001260"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D001260"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D049932"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D049932"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D004194"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D043171"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D001260"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D049932"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T10", "obj": "D049932"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T11", "obj": "D049932"}]}
