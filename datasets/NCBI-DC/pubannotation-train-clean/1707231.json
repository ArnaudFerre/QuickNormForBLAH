A C-to-T transition in exon 4 of the PLP gene was found in 2 affected males and two obligate carriers in a German family with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. The mutation, which causes loss of an HphI site and changes amino acid 155 from threonine to isoleucine, was absent from 108 normal chromosomes. There are 5 concordances and 1 discrepancy between these results and those obtained by magnetic resonance imaging in this family.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 77, "end": 105}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 233, "end": 261}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D020371"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D020371"}]}
