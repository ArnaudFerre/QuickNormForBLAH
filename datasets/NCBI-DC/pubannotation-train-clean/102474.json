By routine screening of sera, a subject was discovered who showed a sub-total deficiency of C6 and C7. No clinical disease was associated with this deficiency which was transmitted through the subjects family as a single genetic characteristic, the C6 deficiency being associated with a silent allele at the structural locus. The propositus was found to have low quantities of an abnormal C6 which was both antigenically deficient and smaller in size than normal C6 (110, 000 daltons compared with 140, 000 daltons) and small quantities of apparently normal C7. It is concluded that the most likely explanation for this defect is that the subject has a structural mutation in his C6 gene which produces hyopsynthesis not only of C6 but also of the closely linked gene for C7. These findings suggest the possibility that C6 and C7 may function as a single genetic unit and that the primary transcript copied from the genome includes information for both proteins.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 40}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 117, "end": 150}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 298, "end": 311}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "OMIM:610102"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T1", "obj": "OMIM:612446"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T2", "obj": "OMIM:610102"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T2", "obj": "OMIM:612446"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T3", "obj": "OMIM:612446"}]}
