Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, BRCA1, predispose individuals to breast and ovarian cancers. Using a combination of affinity- and conventional chromatographic techniques, we have isolated a predominant form of a multiprotein BRCA1-containing complex from human cells displaying chromatin-remodeling activity. Mass spectrometric sequencing of components of this complex indicated that BRCA1 is associated with a SWI/SNF-related complex. We show that BRCA1 can directly interact with the BRG1 subunit of the SWI/SNF complex. Moreover, p53-mediated stimulation of transcription by BRCA1 was completely abrogated by either a dominant-negative mutant of BRG1 or the cancer-causing deletion in exon 11 of BRCA1. These findings reveal a direct function for BRCA1 in transcriptional control through modulation of chromatin structure.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 90, "end": 103}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 131, "end": 136}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 187, "end": 213}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 783, "end": 789}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D001943"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D010051"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D001943"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D009369"}]}
