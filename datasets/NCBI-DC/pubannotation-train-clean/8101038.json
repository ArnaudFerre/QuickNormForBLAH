We identified a patient suffering from late-infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) who has a residual arylsulfatase A (ARSA) activity of about 10%. Fibroblasts of the patient show significant sulfatide degradation activity exceeding that of adult MLD patients. Analysis of the ARSA gene in this patient revealed heterozygosity for two new mutant alleles  in one allele, deletion of C 447 in exon 2 leads to a frameshift and to a premature stop codon at amino acid position 105; in the second allele, a G-- > A transition in exon 5 causes a Gly309-- > Ser substitution. Transient expression of the mutant Ser309-ARSA resulted in only 13% enzyme activity of that observed in cells expressing normal ARSA. The mutant ARSA is correctly targeted to the lysosomes but is unstable. These findings are in contrast to previous results showing that the late-infantile type of MLD is always associated with the complete absence of ARSA activity. The expression of the mutant ARSA protein may be influenced by particular features of oligodendrocytes, such that the level of mutant enzyme is lower in these cells than in others.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 64, "end": 107}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 148, "end": 191}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 193, "end": 196}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 356, "end": 365}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 958, "end": 984}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D007966"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D007966"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D007966"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D007966"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D007966"}]}
