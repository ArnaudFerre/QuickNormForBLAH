Rearrangement of the BCL1 (B-cell lymphoma 1) region on chromosome 11q13 appears to be highly characteristic of centrocytic lymphoma and also is found infrequently in other B-cell neoplasms. Rearrangement is thought to deregulate a nearby protooncogene, but transcribed sequences in the immediate vicinity of BCL1 breakpoints had not been identified. PRAD1, previously designated D11S287E, was identified on 11q13 as a chromosomal breakpoint region rearranged with the parathyroid hormone gene in a subset of parathyroid adenomas; this highly conserved putative oncogene, which encodes a novel cyclin, has been linked to BCL1 and implicated also in subsets of breast and squamous cell neoplasms with 11q13 amplification. We report pulsed-field gel electrophoresis data showing BCL1 and PRAD1 to be no more than 130 kilobases apart. PRAD1 mRNA is abundantly expressed in seven of seven centrocytic lymphomas (Kiel classification), in contrast to 13 closely related but noncentrocytic lymphomas. Three of the seven centrocytic lymphomas had detectable BCL1 DNA rearrangement. Also, two unusual cases of CLL with BCL1 rearrangement overexpressed PRAD1, in contrast to five CLL controls. Thus, PRAD1 is an excellent candidate \" BCL1 oncogene. \" Its overexpression may be a key consequence of rearrangement of the BCL1 vicinity in B-cell neoplasms and a unifying pathogenetic feature in centrocytic lymphoma. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 60, "end": 80}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 194, "end": 214}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 255, "end": 271}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 591, "end": 611}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 742, "end": 776}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 967, "end": 988}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 1050, "end": 1074}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 1095, "end": 1116}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1408, "end": 1424}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 1464, "end": 1484}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D008223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D008223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D016393"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D010282"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D018307"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D001943"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D008223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D008223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D008223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D016393"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T10", "obj": "D008223"}]}
