We describe a patient with typical clinical features of the fragile X syndrome, but without cytogenetic expression of the fragile X or an amplified CCG trinucleotide repeat fragment. The patient has a previously uncharacterized submicroscopic deletion encompassing the CCG repeat, the entire FMR1 gene and about 2. 5 megabases of flanking sequences. This finding confirms that the fragile X phenotype can exist, without amplification of the CCG repeat or cytogenetic expression of the fragile X, and that fragile X syndrome is a genetically homogeneous disorder involving FMR1. We also found random X-inactivation in the mother of the patient who was shown to be a carrier of this deletion. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 18}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 127, "end": 145}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 189, "end": 198}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 448, "end": 457}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 552, "end": 561}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 572, "end": 590}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D005600"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D005600"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D005600"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D005600"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D005600"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D005600"}]}
