Abnormal amplification of a CTG repeat on chromosome 19 is the molecular basis of myotonic dystrophy (DM). Expansion of the repeat has been correlated with severity of several clinical features of the disease. We performed extensive cognitive testing, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a molecular analysis in 28 cases of DM to determine the relationship between the molecular defect and brain disease. Performance in two or more cognitive tests was pathological in 10 cases. Fourteen patients had subcortical white matter lesions on MRI, 14 had cerebral atrophy. Amplification of the CTG repeat showed a strong correlation with cognitive test deficits when exceeding a length of over 1000 trinucleotides. MRI lesions were associated with impaired psychometric performance, but MRI and molecular findings were only weakly related. Disease duration influenced the appearance and amount of white matter lesions on MRI. Quantification of CTG repeat size may allow an early estimate on the probability of brain involvement in DM; cognitive dysfunction is associated with white matter lesions and cerebral atrophy later on in the course.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 13}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 40, "end": 58}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 142, "end": 160}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 162, "end": 164}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 394, "end": 396}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 460, "end": 473}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 582, "end": 602}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 618, "end": 634}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 960, "end": 980}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1094, "end": 1096}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 1098, "end": 1119}}, {"id": "T12", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 1139, "end": 1159}}, {"id": "T13", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1164, "end": 1180}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D001927"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D001927"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D056784"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D001284"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D056784"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T10", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T11", "obj": "D003072"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A12", "subj": "T12", "obj": "D056784"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A13", "subj": "T13", "obj": "D001284"}]}
