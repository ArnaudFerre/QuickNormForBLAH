Immunogenetic analysis of a homozygous C2-deficient individual and family members demonstrated linkage of HLA-A25, B18 and C2o. HLA-D typing showed that 5 members typed with homozygous Dw2 typing cells from an individual with C2 deficiency but not with Dw2 typing cells from 2 individuals with normal C2. The homozygous C2-deficient propositus and brother were HLA-A and B homozygous but heterozygous at the HLA-D and glyoxalase I loci. Therefore, in this family, the C2o gene is linked with two distinct haplotypes  HLA-A25, B18, Dw2, GLO1 and HLA-A25, B18, D unknown, GL02. These results could be explained by an ancestral recombinant event, which occurred between the C2o locus and HLA-D locus in which C2o segregated with HLA-B. This would suggest that the locus for the C2o gene maps between HLA-B and HLA-D on the sixth chromosome.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 24, "end": 37}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 105, "end": 117}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 292, "end": 305}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 386, "end": 398}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}]}
