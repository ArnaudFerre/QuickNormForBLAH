Intestinal uptake of dietary glucose and galactose is mediated by the SGLT1 Na +/glucose cotransporter of the brush border. An SGLT1 missense mutation underlies hereditary glucose/galactose malabsorption, characterized by potentially fatal diarrhea; conversely, oral rehydration therapy exploits normal transport to alleviate life-threatening diarrhea of infectious origin. We have mapped the entire human SGLT1 Na +/glucose cotransporter gene from cosmid and lambda phage clones representing a genomic region of 112 kilobases. Transcription initiation occurred from a site 27 base pairs 3 of a TATAA sequence. All exon-flanking regions were sequenced, and the entire 112-kilobase region mapped with four restriction enzymes. SGLT1 is comprised of 15 exons (spanning 72 kilobases); a possible evolutionary origin from a six-membrane-span ancestral precursor via a gene duplication event is suggested from comparison of exons against protein secondary structure and from sequence considerations. A new missense mutation in exon 1 causing glucose/galactose malabsorption is also described. This is the first Na (+) -dependent cotransporter gene structure reported. These data facilitate the search for new glucose/galactose malabsorption-related mutations in this important gene and provide a basis for future evolutionary comparisons with other Na (+) -dependent cotransporters.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 222, "end": 264}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 301, "end": 309}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 404, "end": 412}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1098, "end": 1129}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1265, "end": 1296}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "OMIM:606824"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D003967"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D003967"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "OMIM:606824"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "OMIM:606824"}]}
