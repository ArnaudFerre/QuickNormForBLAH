Eighty unrelated individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)or Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) were found to have deletions in the major deletion-rich region of the DMD locus. This region includes the last five exons detected by cDNA5b-7, all exons detected by cDNA8, and the first two exons detected by cDNA9. These 80 individuals account for approximately 75% of 109 deletions of the gene, detected among 181 patients analyzed with the entire dystrophin cDNA. Endpoints for many of these deletions were further characterized using two genomic probes, p20 (DXS269; Wapenaar et al.) and GMGX11 (DXS239; present paper). Clinical findings are presented for all 80 patients allowing a correlation of phenotypic severity with the genotype. Thirty-eight independent patients were old enough to be classified as DMD, BMD, or intermediate phenotype and had deletions of exons with sequenced intron/exon boundaries. Of these, eight BMD patients and one intermediate patient had gene deletions predicted to leave the reading frame intact, while 21 DMD patients, 7 intermediate patients, and 1 BMD patient had gene deletions predicted to disrupt the reading frame. Thus, with two exceptions, frameshift deletions of the gene resulted in more severe phenotype than did in-frame deletions. This is in agreement with recent findings by Baumbach et al. and Koenig et al. but is in contrast to findings, by Malhotra et al. at the 5 ' end of the gene.\n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 100, "end": 127}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 129, "end": 132}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 174, "end": 201}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 203, "end": 209}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 210, "end": 235}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 237, "end": 240}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 312, "end": 315}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 953, "end": 956}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 958, "end": 961}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1071, "end": 1074}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1186, "end": 1189}}, {"id": "T12", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1231, "end": 1234}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "C537666"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "C537666"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "C537666"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T10", "obj": "C537666"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T11", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A12", "subj": "T12", "obj": "C537666"}]}
