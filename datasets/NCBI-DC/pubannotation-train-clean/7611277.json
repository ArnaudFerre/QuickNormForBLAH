{"target": "http://pubannotation.org/docs/sourcedb/PubMed//sourceid/7611277", "sourcedb": "PubMed", "sourceid": "7611277", "text": "Detection of eight BRCA1 mutations in 10 breast/ovarian cancer families, including 1 family with male breast cancer. Genetic epidemiological evidence suggests that mutations in BRCA1 may be responsible for approximately one half of early onset familial breast cancer and the majority of familial breast/ovarian cancer. The recent cloning of BRCA1 allows for the direct detection of mutations, but the feasibility of presymptomatic screening for cancer susceptibility is unknown. We analyzed genomic DNA from one affected individual from each of 24 families with at least three cases of ovarian or breast cancer, using SSCP assays. Variant SSCP bands were subcloned and sequenced. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization was used to verify sequence changes and to screen DNA from control individuals. Six frameshift and two missense mutations were detected in 10 different families. A frameshift mutation was detected in a male proband affected with both breast and prostate cancer. A 40-bp deletion was detected in a patient who developed intra-abdominal carcinomatosis 1 year after prophylactic oophorectomy. Mutations were detected throughout the gene, and only one was detected in more than a single family. These results provide further evidence that inherited breast and ovarian cancer can occur as a consequence of a wide array of BRCA1 mutations. These results suggests that development of a screening test for BRCA1 mutations will be technically challenging. The finding of a mutation in a family with male breast cancer, not previously thought to be related to BRCA1, also illustrates the potential difficulties of genetic counseling for individuals known to carry mutations.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 41, "end": 62}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 97, "end": 115}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 244, "end": 266}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 287, "end": 317}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 445, "end": 451}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 586, "end": 610}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 960, "end": 986}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 1045, "end": 1075}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 1261, "end": 1296}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1516, "end": 1534}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D061325"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D018567"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D001943"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D061325"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D010051"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D001943"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D011471"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D001943"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D002277"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D000008"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A12", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D061325"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A13", "subj": "T10", "obj": "D018567"}]}
