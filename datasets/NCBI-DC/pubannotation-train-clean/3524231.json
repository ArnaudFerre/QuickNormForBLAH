A controlled, double-blind therapeutic trial with the drug mazindol, a growth hormone inhibitor, was performed in a pair of 7 1/2 year-old monozygotic twins, with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The rationale for this trial was based on a patient (reported previously) affected simultaneously with DMD and growth hormone (GH) deficiency, who is showing a benign course of the dystrophic process and is still walking at 18 years. One of the twins received 2 mg of mazindol daily, while the other received a placebo. The assessment, repeated every 2 months, included weight and height measurements, functional and motor ability tests, ergometry and determinations of serum enzymes and GH levels. After one year of trial the code was broken and it was seen that the twin under placebo treatment was strikingly worse than his brother, the progression of whose condition was practically arrested. These results strongly suggest that treatment with a GH inhibitor is beneficial for DMD patients.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 13, "end": 40}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 236, "end": 263}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 265, "end": 268}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 374, "end": 377}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 382, "end": 412}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 452, "end": 470}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1052, "end": 1055}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "OMIM:262400"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D009136"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D020388"}]}
