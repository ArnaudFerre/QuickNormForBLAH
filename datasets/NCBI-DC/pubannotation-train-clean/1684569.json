{"target": "http://pubannotation.org/docs/sourcedb/PubMed//sourceid/1684569", "sourcedb": "PubMed", "sourceid": "1684569", "text": "Analysis of X-chromosome inactivation and presumptive expression of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) gene in hematopoietic cell lineages of a thrombocytopenic carrier female of WAS. We report on a thrombocytopenic female belonging to a pedigree with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with probe M27 beta, closely linked to the WAS gene, demonstrated that she is a carrier of WAS. Both small-sized and normal-sized platelets were present, suggesting that, unlike the vast majority of WAS carriers, she does not manifest nonrandom X-chromosome inactivation in the thrombopoietic cell lineage. Study of X-chromosome inactivation by means of RFLP and methylation analysis demonstrated that the pattern of X-chromosome inactivation was nonrandom in T lymphocytes, but random in granulocytes. While this is the first complete report on the occurrence of thrombocytopenia in a carrier female of WAS as the result of atypical lyonization, it also suggests that expression of the WAS gene occurs at (or extends up to) a later stage than the multipotent stem cell along the hematopoietic differentiation pathway.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 72, "end": 96}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 98, "end": 101}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 179, "end": 182}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 199, "end": 215}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 256, "end": 280}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 282, "end": 285}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 388, "end": 391}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 436, "end": 439}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 544, "end": 547}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 909, "end": 925}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 949, "end": 952}}, {"id": "T12", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1032, "end": 1035}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D014923"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D014923"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D014923"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D013921"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D014923"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D014923"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D014923"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D014923"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D014923"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T10", "obj": "D013921"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T11", "obj": "D014923"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A12", "subj": "T12", "obj": "D014923"}]}
