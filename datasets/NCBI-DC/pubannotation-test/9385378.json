In previous studies, we have found two common mutations in Caucasians and Japanese, respectively. To characterize the mutational spectrum in various ethnic groups, mutations in the GALNS gene in Colombian MPS IVA patients were investigated, and genetic backgrounds were extensively analyzed to identify racial origin, based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages. Three novel missense mutations never identified previously in other populations and found in 16 out of 19 Colombian MPS IVA unrelated alleles account for 84. 2% of the alleles in this study. The G301C and S162F mutations account for 68. 4% and 10. 5% of mutations, respectively, whereas the remaining F69V is limited to a single allele. The skewed prevalence of G301C in only Colombian patients and haplotype analysis by restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the GALNS gene suggest that G301C originated from a common ancestor. Investigation of the genetic background by means of mtDNA lineages indicate that all our patients are probably of native American descent \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "96", "end": "121"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "123", "end": "148"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "150", "end": "157"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": "165", "end": "211"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": "224", "end": "238"}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "498", "end": "505"}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "772", "end": "779"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "OMIM:253000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "OMIM:253000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "OMIM:253000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D016464"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D030342"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "OMIM:253000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "OMIM:253000"}]}
