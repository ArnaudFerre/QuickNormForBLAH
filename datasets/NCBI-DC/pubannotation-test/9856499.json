All these new molecular defects involve single-nucleotide events, deletions and substitutions, some of which alter splice sites, and others codons. They are distributed along the C7 gene, but predominantly towards the 3 end. All were found in compound heterozygous individuals. The C6/C7 marker haplotypes associated with most C7 defects are tabulated.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "0", "end": "24"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "131", "end": "144"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "487", "end": "497"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "OMIM:610102"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "OMIM:610102"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "OMIM:610102"}]}
