To date, mutation screening in the two genes has been hampered by the lack of genomic structure information. We report here the complete characterization of the 48 exons of the COL4A4 gene, a comprehensive gene screen, and the subsequent detection of 10 novel mutations in eight patients diagnosed with autosomal recessive Alport syndrome. Furthermore, we identified a glycine to alanine substitution in the collagenous domain that is apparently silent in the heterozygous carriers, in 11. 5% of all control individuals, and in one control individual homozygous for this glycine substitution. There has been no previous finding of a glycine substitution that is not associated with any obvious phenotype in homozygous individuals. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "89", "end": "124"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "126", "end": "161"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "179", "end": "207"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": "225", "end": "267"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "716", "end": "751"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "C536587"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "C536587"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D005921"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D005921"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "C536587"}]}
