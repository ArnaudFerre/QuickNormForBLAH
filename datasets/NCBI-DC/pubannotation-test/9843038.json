Only 11 mutations of the gene have been reported in HCP patients. We report another mutation in a Japanese family. Polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism and direct sequence analyses demonstrated a C to T substitution in exon 1 of the CPO gene at nucleotide position 85, which lies in the putative presequence for targeting to mitochondria. This mutation changes the codon for glutamine to a termination codon at amino acid position 29. MaeI restriction analysis showed two other carriers in the family. The C-T mutation is located within a recently proposed putative alternative translation initiation codon (TIC-1), supporting that TIC-1 is the real TIC rather than TIC-2.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "65", "end": "90"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "99", "end": "124"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "126", "end": "129"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": "137", "end": "163"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "183", "end": "223"}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "320", "end": "323"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D046349"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D046349"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D046349"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D030342"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D046349"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D046349"}]}
