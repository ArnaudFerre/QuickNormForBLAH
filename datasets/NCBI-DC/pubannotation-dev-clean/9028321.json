Programmed cell death (or apoptosis) is a physiological process essential to the normal development and homeostatic maintenance of the immune system. The Fas/Apo-1 receptor plays a crucial role in the regulation of apoptosis, as demonstrated by lymphoproliferation in MRL-lpr/lpr mice and by the recently described autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) in humans, both of which are due to mutations in the Fas gene. We describe a novel family with ALPS in which three affected siblings carry two distinct missense mutations on both the Fas gene alleles and show lack of Fas-induced apoptosis. The children share common clinical features including splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy, but only one developed severe autoimmune manifestations. In all three siblings, we demonstrated the presence of anergic CD3 + CD4-CD8- (double negative, [DN]) T cells; moreover, a chronic lymphocyte activation was found, as demonstrated by the presence of high levels of HLA-DR expression on peripheral CD3 + cells and by the presence of high levels of serum activation markers such as soluble interleukin-2 receptor (slL-2R) and soluble CD30 (sCD30).. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-dev", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 48, "end": 87}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 444, "end": 483}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 485, "end": 489}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 586, "end": 590}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 785, "end": 797}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 802, "end": 817}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 849, "end": 874}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D056735"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D056735"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D056735"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D056735"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D013163"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D008206"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D001327"}]}
