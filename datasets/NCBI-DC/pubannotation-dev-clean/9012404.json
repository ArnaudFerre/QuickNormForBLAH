A population-based series of 54 male breast cancer cases from Southern California were analyzed for germ-line mutations in the inherited breast/ovarian cancer genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Nine (17%) of the patients had a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer in at least one first-degree relative. A further seven (13%) of the patients reported breast/ovarian cancer in at least one second-degree relative and in no first-degree relatives. No germ-line BRCA1 mutations were found. Two male breast cancer patients (4% of the total) were found to carry novel truncating mutations in the BRCA2 gene. Only one of the two male breast cancer patients carrying a BRCA2 mutation had a family history of cancer, with one case of ovarian cancer in a first-degree relative. The remaining eight cases (89%) of male breast cancer with a family history of breast/ovarian cancer in first-degree relatives remain unaccounted for by mutations in either the BRCA1 gene or the BRCA2 gene.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-dev", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 60}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 105, "end": 123}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 200, "end": 231}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 307, "end": 335}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 422, "end": 443}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 562, "end": 580}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 694, "end": 712}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 772, "end": 778}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 797, "end": 811}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 875, "end": 893}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 919, "end": 940}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D018567"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D018567"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D061325"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D061325"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D061325"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D018567"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D018567"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D010051"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T10", "obj": "D018567"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T11", "obj": "D061325"}]}
