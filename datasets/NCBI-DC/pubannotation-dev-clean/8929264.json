BACKGROUND  Allelic loss of chromosome 18q predicts a poor outcome in patients with stage II colorectal cancer. Although the specific gene inactivated by this allelic loss has not been elucidated, the DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) gene is a candidate. We investigated whether the expression of the DCC protein in tumor cells is a prognostic marker in colorectal carcinoma. METHODS  The expression of DCC was evaluated immunohistochemically in 132 paraffin-embedded samples from patients with curatively resected stage II and III colorectal carcinomas. The Cox proportional-hazards model was used to adjust for covariates including age, sex, tumor site, degree of tumor differentiation, and use of adjuvant therapy. RESULTS  The expression of DCC was a strong positive predictive factor for survival in both stage II and stage III colorectal carcinomas. In patients with stage II disease whose tumors expressed DCC, the five-year survival rate was 94. 3 percent, whereas in patients with DCC-negative tumors, the survival rate was 61. 6 percent (P < 0. 001). In patients with stage III disease, the respective survival rates were 59. 3 percent and 33. 2 percent (P = 0. 03). CONCLUSIONS  DCC is a prognostic marker in patients with stage II or stage III colorectal cancer. In stage II colorectal carcinomas, the absence of DCC identifies a subgroup of patients with lesions that behave like stage III cancers. These findings may thus have therapeutic implications in this group of patients \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-dev", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 50}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 136, "end": 162}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 269, "end": 286}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 370, "end": 375}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 408, "end": 428}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 569, "end": 607}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 698, "end": 703}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 720, "end": 725}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 864, "end": 908}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 950, "end": 956}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1044, "end": 1063}}, {"id": "T12", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1132, "end": 1149}}, {"id": "T13", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 1288, "end": 1327}}, {"id": "T14", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1332, "end": 1362}}, {"id": "T15", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 1447, "end": 1464}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D015179"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D015179"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D015179"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D015179"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D015179"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D015179"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T10", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T11", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A12", "subj": "T12", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A13", "subj": "T13", "obj": "D015179"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A14", "subj": "T14", "obj": "D015179"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A15", "subj": "T15", "obj": "D009369"}]}
