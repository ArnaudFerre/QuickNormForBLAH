The Rb1 gene has been implicated with retinoblastoma and is located on human Chromosome (Chr) 13q14. 2 2. A unique sequence human Rb1 cosmid DNA probe has been used to localize this region on apes Chr 14 by the FISH technique. The conservation of the Rb1 gene in higher primates at the corresponding equivalent chromosome locus (14q14) of the human may serve as a phylogenetic marker to further trace the evolutionary pathway of human descent. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-dev", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 117, "end": 131}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D012175"}]}
