We show that local or global alterations in the structure of the cytoplasmic death domain from nine independent ALPS CD95 death-domain mutations result in a failure to bind the FADD/MORT1 signaling protein. Despite heterozygosity for the abnormal allele, lymphocytes from ALPS patients showed markedly decreased FADD association and a loss of caspase recruitment and activation after CD95 crosslinking. These data suggest that intracytoplasmic CD95 mutations in ALPS impair apoptosis chiefly by disrupting death-domain interactions with the signaling protein FADD/MORT1.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 63, "end": 112}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 201, "end": 240}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 241, "end": 246}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 425, "end": 429}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 585, "end": 589}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 775, "end": 779}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D056735"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D056735"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D056735"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D056735"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D056735"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D056735"}]}
