The most likely order was cent-AT-S144-THY1. The present paper describes further mapping of the AT locus by means of a panel of 10 markers that span approximately 60 cM in the 11q22-23 region centered around S144 and THY1. Location scores indicate that three contiguous subsegments within the [S144-THY1] segment, as well as three contiguous segments telomeric to THY1, are each unlikely to contain the AT locus, while the more centromeric [STMY-S144] segment is most likely to contain the AT locus. These data, together with recent refinements in the linkage and physical maps of 11q22-23, place the AT locus at 11q23. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 22, "end": 43}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 115, "end": 136}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 347, "end": 349}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 654, "end": 656}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 741, "end": 743}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 852, "end": 854}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D001260"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D001260"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D001260"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D001260"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D001260"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D001260"}]}
