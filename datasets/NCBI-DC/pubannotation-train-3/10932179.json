Despite its widespread expression, mutant huntingtin induces selective neuronal loss in striatal neurons. Here we report that, in mutant mice expressing HD repeats, the production and aggregation of N-terminal huntingtin fragments preferentially occur in HD-affected neurons and their processes and axonal terminals. N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin form aggregates and induce neuritic degeneration in cultured striatal neurons. N-terminal mutant huntingtin also binds to synaptic vesicles and inhibits their glutamate uptake in vitro. The specific processing and accumulation of toxic fragments of N-terminal huntingtin in HD-affected striatal neurons, especially in their neuronal processes and axonal terminals, may contribute to the selective neuropathology of HD.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 116, "end": 136}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 137, "end": 140}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 384, "end": 386}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 486, "end": 488}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 617, "end": 638}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 864, "end": 866}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1005, "end": 1007}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D006816"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D006816"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D006816"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D006816"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D009410"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D006816"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D006816"}]}
