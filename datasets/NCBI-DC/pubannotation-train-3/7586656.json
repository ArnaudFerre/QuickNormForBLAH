A 5 kb DNA sequence deletion was found to have its endpoints in the first and third introns. The probes identified the carrier status of female family members, aided by an RFLP carried by the mothers normal X-chromosome.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 113, "end": 133}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 275, "end": 297}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 308, "end": 328}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D007926"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D007926"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D007926"}]}
