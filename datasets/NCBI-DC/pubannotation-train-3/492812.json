To explore the pathogenesis of recurrent neisserial infections in C6 deficiency, a detailed analysis of her immune competence was conducted. Her serum had normal chemotactic, opsonic, alternative complement pathway, and specific antibody activity, but lacked complement-mediated bacteriolytic activity. In addition, her C6-deficient serum was indistinguishable from normal serum in a complement-dependent assay of phagocyte bactericidal activity. Absent bacteriolysis remains the only consistent defect associated with recurrent neisserial infections and absence of one of the late-acting complement components.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 10, "end": 34}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 40, "end": 84}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 181, "end": 205}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 210, "end": 254}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 314, "end": 335}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 339, "end": 352}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 593, "end": 605}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 802, "end": 823}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D008585"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "OMIM:612446"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D008585"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "OMIM:612446"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D016870"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "OMIM:612446"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "OMIM:612446"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D016870"}]}
