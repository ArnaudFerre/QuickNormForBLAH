With her it became possible to determine whether allelic exclusion occurs in particular cell-types of the WAS carrier. If so, the remaining cells of a particular cell-type would express only the normal X chromosome and only one glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase isoenzyme would be demonstrable. This carrier had only the B isoenzyme of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in platelets and thymus-derived T lymphocytes, although both isoenzymes A and B were present in erythrocytes and neutrophils. These findings suggest that selection against the WAS gene occurs in platelets and thymus-derived T lymphocytes and that the defects associated with WAS expressed in these cell-types may be implicated in the genesis of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 93, "end": 117}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 155, "end": 179}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 180, "end": 184}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 397, "end": 400}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 837, "end": 840}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 936, "end": 939}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1010, "end": 1034}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D014923"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D014923"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D014923"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D014923"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D014923"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D014923"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D014923"}]}
