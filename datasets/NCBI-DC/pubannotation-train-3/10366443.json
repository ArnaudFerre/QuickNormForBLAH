Normal feline beta-glucuronidase cDNA was cloned and characterized, and amplified from affected cat fibroblasts by reverse transcription coupled polymerase chain reaction. There was a G-to-A transition in the affected cat cDNA that predicted an E351K substitution, destroyed a BssSI site, and eliminated GUSB enzymatic activity in expression studies. Multiple species comparison and the crystal structure of human beta-glucuronidase indicated that E351 is a highly conserved residue most likely essential in maintenance of the enzymes conformation. BssSI digestion of polymerase chain reaction products amplified from genomic DNA indicated that affected cats were homozygous and cats with half-normal beta-glucuronidase activity were heterozygous for the missense mutation. Carriers identified in this manner produced affected kittens in prospective breedings, and a feline MPS VII breeding colony has been established.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 26, "end": 55}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 76, "end": 101}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 210, "end": 235}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 240, "end": 286}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 297, "end": 326}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1433, "end": 1440}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D016538"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D016538"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D016538"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D016464"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D016538"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D016538"}]}
