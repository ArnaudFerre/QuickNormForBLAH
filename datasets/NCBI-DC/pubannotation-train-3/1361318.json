A family with inherited deficiency of complement factor 2 (C2) is described in which two family members with homozygous C2 deficiency developed cutaneous vasculitis and sicca syndrome. The other family members had heterozygous C2 deficiency and each member had the HLA-A25, B18, DR2 (w15) haplotype. The mother had seropositive rheumatoid arthritis. Further studies showed the presence of cryoglobulins, antibodies against endothelial cells, and anticardiolipin antibodies.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 30}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 72, "end": 107}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 183, "end": 224}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 289, "end": 302}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 313, "end": 333}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 338, "end": 352}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 396, "end": 409}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 484, "end": 517}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D007153"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D018366"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D012859"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D001172"}]}
