This method involves the selective amplification of a DNA fragment from human G6PD gene with specific oligonucleotide primers followed by digestion with restriction enzymes that recognize artificially created or naturally occurring restriction sites. Ninety-four Chinese males with G6PD deficiency were studied. The results show that 50% (47 of 94) were G to T mutation at nucleotide (nt) 1376, 21. 3% (20 of 94) were G to A mutation at nt 1388, 7. 4% (7 of 94) were A to G mutation at nt 493, 7. 4% (7 of 94) were A to G mutation at nt 95, 4. 2% (4 of 94) were C to T mutation at nt 1024, 1. 1% (1 of 94) was G to T mutation at nt 392, and 1. 1% (1 of 94) was G to A mutation at nt 487. These results show that the former five mutations account for more than 90% of G6PD deficiency cases in Taiwan. Aside from showing that G to T change at nt 1376 is the most common mutation, our research indicates that nt 493 mutation is a frequent mutation among Chinese in Taiwan. We compared G6PD activity among different mutations, without discovering significant differences between them.\n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 30, "end": 81}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 170, "end": 185}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 285, "end": 336}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 641, "end": 656}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1126, "end": 1141}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D005955"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D005955"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D005955"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D005955"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D005955"}]}
