By high-resolution banding we have characterized the deletion chromosomes as del (X) (q21. 1-q21 1-q21. 33) and del (X) (q21. 2-q21 2-q21. 31) respectively. By Southern blot analysis we have mapped ten different polymorphic DNA loci relative to the position of the deletion and the choroideremia locus TCD. One probe, p31, was shown to cover one of the breakpoints of the smallest deletion. The following order of the loci was suggested by deletion mapping  cen-DXS106-DXS72-TCD- (DXYS1/DXYS23/DXYS5) - DXYS2- (DXYS12/DXS3) - (DXS17/DXS101) - Xqter.\n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 123, "end": 136}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 209, "end": 222}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 602, "end": 615}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D015794"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D015794"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D015794"}]}
