The family of the propositus had a strong history of myotonic dystrophy, and there was an intrafamilial pathological expansion of the responsible CTG repeat between the mildly affected mother (160 repeats; normal 27 repeats) and her more severely affected son (650 repeats), and his sister (650 repeats). The propositus was an isolated case of Duchenne muscular dystrophy with marked dystrophin deficiency in muscle biopsy. The patient was still ambulatory post age 16. Myotonic dystrophy could interfere to some extent with the progression of Duchenne dystrophy. However, other interpretations are possible. Twelve percent of dystrophin revertant fibers as observed by immunohistochemistry could be sufficient to ameliorate typical DMD clinical severity, or the patient may present a somatic mosaic. The pathophysiological interactions of these two unlinked disorders are discussed at the clinical and histopathological levels.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 27}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 32, "end": 50}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 120, "end": 138}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 143, "end": 170}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 171, "end": 175}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 231, "end": 249}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 522, "end": 549}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 562, "end": 583}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 648, "end": 666}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 722, "end": 740}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 911, "end": 914}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T10", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T11", "obj": "D020388"}]}
