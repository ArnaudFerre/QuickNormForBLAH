We report three new cases, two carrying a previously described WT1 exon 9 mutation and one with a novel WT1 exon 8 mutation. However, unlike patients in previous reports, one of our three patients inherited the affected allele from his phenotypically unaffected father. This observation indicates that the WT1 exon 9 mutation affecting 394Arg demonstrated in over one-half of the patients with the Denys-Drash syndrome may exhibit incomplete penetrance. Consequently, familial studies in patients affected by this syndrome are recommended.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 26, "end": 46}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 67, "end": 87}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 88, "end": 100}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 102, "end": 119}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 125, "end": 136}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 215, "end": 226}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 651, "end": 671}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D030321"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D030321"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D009396"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D014564"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D007674"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D009396"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D030321"}]}
