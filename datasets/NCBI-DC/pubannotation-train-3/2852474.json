All patients had muscular dystrophy or muscle weakness, mental retardation, congenital adrenal hypoplasia, and glycerol kinase deficiency. High-resolution GTG-banded chromosomes showed a microdeletion in the Xp21 region in all four patients examined and in all five mothers. Southern hybridizations, after digestions by restriction endonucleases, with various cloned DNAs (D2, 99-6, B24, C7, L1-4, cDMD13-14, J66-HI, P20, J-Bir, ERT87-30, ERT87-15, ERT87-8, ERT87-1, XJ-1. 1, 754, cx5. 7, and OTC-1) that are located around Xp21 also showed a deletion in the genome of all patients and mothers. Although the deletion differed in size among patients, a segment commonly absent was located between the genomic sequences corresponding to L1-4 and cDMD13-14. This finding indicated that the gene coding for glycerol kinase (GK) is located within this segment. A comparison of the clinical manifestations of the present five patients and reported CGKD or Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients with DNA deletion suggests the existence of a certain gene responsible for gonadotropin deficiency (GTD). The result of the present study and results of previous studies suggest that genes for ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), DMD, and GK and putative genes responsible for congenital adrenal hypoplasia (AHC) and GTD are arranged from telomere to centromere as pter--GTD--AHC--GK--DMD--OTC--cen \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 34}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 150, "end": 184}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 185, "end": 190}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 298, "end": 316}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 320, "end": 335}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 337, "end": 355}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 357, "end": 386}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 392, "end": 418}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1223, "end": 1227}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1231, "end": 1258}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1259, "end": 1263}}, {"id": "T12", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1349, "end": 1372}}, {"id": "T13", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1373, "end": 1377}}, {"id": "T14", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1501, "end": 1504}}, {"id": "T15", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1548, "end": 1577}}, {"id": "T16", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1578, "end": 1582}}, {"id": "T17", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1588, "end": 1591}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "C538138"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "C538138"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "C538138"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D009136"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D018908"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D008607"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D000312"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "C538138"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "C538138"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T10", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T11", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A12", "subj": "T12", "obj": "C535764"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A13", "subj": "T13", "obj": "C535764"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A14", "subj": "T14", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A15", "subj": "T15", "obj": "D000312"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A16", "subj": "T16", "obj": "D000312"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A17", "subj": "T17", "obj": "C535764"}]}
