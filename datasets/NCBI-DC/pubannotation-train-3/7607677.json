We found two separate deletions of nearly 8. 0 and 6. 0 kb in the GALNS gene, including some exons. There are Alu repetitive elements near the breakpoints of the 8. 0-kb deletion, and this deletion resulted from an Alu-Alu recombination. The other 6. 0-kb deletion involved illegitimate recombinational events between incomplete short direct repeats of 8 bp at deletion breakpoints. The same rearrangement has been observed in a heteroallelic state in four unrelated patients. This is the first documentation of a common double deletion a gene that is not a member of a gene cluster.\n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 30}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 109, "end": 136}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 137, "end": 145}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 153, "end": 181}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 194, "end": 241}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D009085"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D009085"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D009085"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D030342"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D009085"}]}
