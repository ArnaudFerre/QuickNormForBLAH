However, healthy subjects found to be deficient in Hex A activity (i. e., pseudodeficient) by means of in vitro biochemical tests have been described. We analyzed the HEXA gene of one pseudodeficient subject and identified both a C739-to-T substitution that changes Arg247----Trp on one allele and a previously identified Tay-Sachs disease mutation on the second allele. Six additional pseudodeficient subjects were found to have the C739-to-T mutation. This allele accounted for 32% (20/62) of non-Jewish enzyme-defined Tay-Sachs disease carriers but for none of 36 Jewish enzyme-defined carriers who did not have one of three known mutations common to this group. The C739-to-T allele, together with a \" true \" Tay-Sachs disease allele, causes Hex A pseudodeficiency. Given both the large proportion of non-Jewish carriers with this allele and that standard biochemical screening cannot differentiate between heterozygotes for the C739-to-T mutations and Tay-Sachs disease carriers, DNA testing for this mutation in at-risk couples is essential. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 47, "end": 56}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 102, "end": 137}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 178, "end": 195}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 235, "end": 251}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 519, "end": 536}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 718, "end": 735}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 910, "end": 927}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1154, "end": 1171}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D013661"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D013661"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D013661"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D013661"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D013661"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D013661"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D013661"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D013661"}]}
