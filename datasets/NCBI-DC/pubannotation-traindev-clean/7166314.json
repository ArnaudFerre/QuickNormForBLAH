A new glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) variant associated with chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia was reported. The patient, a 6-year-old Japanese male, was noticed to have hemolytic anemia soon after birth, and a diagnosis of G6PD deficiency was made at the age of 2. He had episodes of hemolytic crisis several times after upper respiratory infection. G6PD activity of the patient was 5. 5% of normal. The enzymatic characteristics were examined when he was 5 years old, and his G6PD showed faster-than-normal electrophoretic mobility, low Km G6P, high Km NADP, low Ki NADPH, normal utilization of substrate analogues, heat instability, and a normal pH optimum curve. From these results, this was considered to be a new variant and was designated G6PD Nagano. Infection-induced hemolysis and chronic hemolytic anemia seem to be due to markedly impaired enzyme activity and thermal instability. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 78, "end": 105}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 178, "end": 217}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 293, "end": 309}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 347, "end": 362}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 408, "end": 424}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 445, "end": 472}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 900, "end": 909}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 914, "end": 938}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D000745"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D000746"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D000743"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D005955"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D006461"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D012141"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D006461"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D000745"}]}
