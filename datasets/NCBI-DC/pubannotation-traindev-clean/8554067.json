We have analyzed 20 breast-ovarian cancer families, the majority of which show positive evidence of linkage to chromosome 17q12 for germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 gene. BRCA1 mutations cosegregating with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility were identified in 16 families, including 1 family with a case of male breast cancer. Nine of these mutations have not been reported previously. The majority of mutations were found to generate a premature stop codon leading to the formation of a truncated BRCA1 protein of 2% -88% of the expected normal length. Two mutations altered the RING finger domain. Sequencing of genomic DNA led to the identification of a mutation in the coding region of BRCA1 in 12 families, and cDNA analysis revealed an abnormal or missing BRCA1 transcript in 4 of the 8 remaining families. A total of eight mutations were associated with a reduced quantity of BRCA1 transcript. We were unable to detect BRCA1 mutations in 4 of the 20 families, but only 1 of these was clearly linked to BRCA1. It is expected that the majority of clear examples of the breast-ovarian syndrome will be associated with germ-line mutations in the coding region of BRCA1.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 63}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 94, "end": 115}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 280, "end": 305}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 387, "end": 405}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1154, "end": 1177}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D061325"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D061325"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D061325"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D018567"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D061325"}]}
