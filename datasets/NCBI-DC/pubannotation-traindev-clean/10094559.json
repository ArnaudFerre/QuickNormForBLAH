Alkaptonuria (aku), an inborn error of metabolism caused by the loss of homogentisate 1, 2-dioxygenase (HGD), has been described in a mouse model created by ethylnitrosourea mutagenesis but the mutation in these mice has not previously been identified. We used RT-PCR to amplify the Hgd cDNA from Hgd (aku)/Hgd (aku) mice. Two products shorter than the wild-type product were amplified. Restriction mapping and DNA sequencing were then used to identify the Hgd (aku) mouse mutation, found to be a single base change in a splice donor consensus sequence, causing exon skipping and frame-shifted products. This base change allowed us to create a non-radioactive genotyping assay for this allele. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 38, "end": 50}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 64, "end": 76}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 78, "end": 81}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 87, "end": 113}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D000474"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D000474"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D000474"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D008661"}]}
