A 28-base pair gene deletion causes skipping of exon 6 during RNA splicing. Two variants of a genetic deficiency of complement protein C2 (C2D) have been previously identified. No C2 protein translation is detected in type I deficiency, while type II deficiency is characterized by a selective block in C2 secretion. Type I C2 deficiency was described in a family in which the C2 null allele (C2Q0) is associated with the major histocompatibility haplotype/complotype HLA-A25, B18, C2Q0, BfS, C4A4, C4B2, Drw2; this extended haplotype occurs in over 90% of C2-deficient individuals (common complotype/haplotype). To determine the molecular basis of type I C2 deficiency, the C2 gene and cDNA were characterized from a homozygous type I C2-deficient individual with the common associated haplotype/complotype. We found a 28-base pair deletion in the type I C2Q0 gene, beginning 9 base pairs upstream of the 3-end of exon 6, that generates a C2 transcript with a complete deletion of exon 6 (134 base pair) and a premature termination codon. In studies of eight kindred, the 28-base pair deletion was observed in all C2Q0 alleles associated with the common type I deficient complotype/haplotype; this deletion was not present in normal C2 nor in type II C2-deficient genes. These data demonstrate that  1) type I human complement C2 deficiency is caused by a 28-base pair genomic deletion that causes skipping of exon 6 during RNA splicing, resulting in generation of a premature termination codon, 2) the 28-base pair deletion in the type I C2Q0 gene is strongly associated with the HLA haplotype/complotype A25, B18, C2Q0, BfS, C4A4, C4B2, Drw2, suggesting that all C2-deficient individuals with this haplotype/complotype will harbor the 28-base pair C2 gene deletion, and 3) type II C2 deficiency is caused by a different, as yet uncharacterized, molecular genetic defect.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 37}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 141, "end": 176}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 356, "end": 376}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 596, "end": 608}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 688, "end": 708}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 768, "end": 787}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1283, "end": 1303}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1343, "end": 1380}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1705, "end": 1717}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1815, "end": 1836}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 1897, "end": 1911}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T10", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T11", "obj": "D030342"}]}
