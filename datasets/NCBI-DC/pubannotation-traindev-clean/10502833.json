Argininemia is a rare autossomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency in the cytosolic liver-type arginase enzyme (L-arginine urea-hydrolase; E. C. 3. 5. 3. 1). In order to investigate the molecular basis for argininemia in four unrelated Portuguese patients (two from northern Portugal and two from Madeira Island) we performed a DNA sequence analysis of all the exons and exon/intron boundaries of the liver-type arginase gene (ARG1). All patients were found to be homozygous for a newly identified C - > T transition in codon 21 (exon 2) substituting arginine for a premature stop codon (R21X  CGA to TGA) and generating a NlaIII restriction site. Restriction digestion following PCR amplification of ARG1 exon 2 confirmed the presence of the mutation.\n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 112, "end": 123}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 125, "end": 136}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 147, "end": 176}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 187, "end": 241}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 337, "end": 348}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D020162"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D020162"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D030342"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D020162"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D020162"}]}
