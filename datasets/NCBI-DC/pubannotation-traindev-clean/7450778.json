Four new G6PD variants have been characterized in individuals from Papua New Guinea. This study demonstrates that the previously reported Markham variant and the newly characterized Salata variant may be widely distributed in Papua New Guinea. Th data presented here together with those of previously published studies demonstrate a degree of heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency that is much higher than that in other regions of the world where G6PD deficiency is common.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 38, "end": 82}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 464, "end": 479}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 546, "end": 561}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D005955"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D005955"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D005955"}]}
