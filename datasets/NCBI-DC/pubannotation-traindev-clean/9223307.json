A gene mutated in the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), ATM, was recently identified by positional cloning. ATM is a member of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase superfamily, some of which are protein kinases and appear to have important roles in cell cycle control and radiation signal transduction. We describe herein, to our knowledge, for the first time, the cloning of a full-length cDNA for ATM and correction of multiple aspects of the radio-sensitive phenotype of A-T cells by transfection with this cDNA. Overexpression of ATM cDNA in A-T cells enhanced the survival of these cells in response to radiation exposure, decreased radiation-induced chromosome aberrations, reduced radio-resistant DNA synthesis, and partially corrected defective cell cycle checkpoints and induction of stress-activated protein kinase. This correction of the defects in A-T cells provides further evidence of the multiplicity of effector functions of the ATM protein and suggests possible approaches to gene therapy.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-dev", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 56, "end": 77}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 126, "end": 142}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 143, "end": 164}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 166, "end": 169}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 587, "end": 590}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 659, "end": 662}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 973, "end": 976}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D001260"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D030342"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D001260"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D001260"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D001260"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D001260"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D001260"}]}
