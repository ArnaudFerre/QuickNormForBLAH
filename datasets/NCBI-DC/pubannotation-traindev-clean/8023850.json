Canavan disease is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy caused by the deficiency of aspartoacylase (ASPA). Sixty-four probands were analyzed for mutations in the ASPA gene. Three point mutations--693C-- > A, 854A-- > C, and 914C-- > A--were identified in the coding sequence. The 693C-- > A and 914C-- > A base changes, resulting in nonsense tyr231-- > ter and missense ala305-- > glu mutations, respectively, lead to complete loss of ASPA activity in in vitro expression studies. The 854A-- > C transversion converted glu to ala in codon 285. The glu285-- > ala mutant ASPA has 2. 5% of the activity expressed by the wild-type enzyme. A fourth mutation, 433 --2 (A-- > G) transition, was identified at the splice-acceptor site in intron 2. The splice-site mutation would lead to skipping of exon 3, accompanied by a frameshift, and thus would produce aberrant ASPA. Of the 128 unrelated Canavan chromosomes analyzed, 88 were from probands of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. The glu285-- > ala mutation was predominant (82. 9%) in this population, followed by the tyr231-- > ter (14. 8%) and 433 --2 (A-- > G) (1. 1%) mutations. The three mutations account for 98. 8% of the Canavan chromosomes of Ashkenazi Jewish origin. The ala305-- > glu mutation was found exclusively in non-Jewish probands of European descent and constituted 60% of the 40 mutant chromosomes. Predominant occurrence of certain mutations among Ashkenazi Jewish and non-Jewish patients with Canavan disease would suggest a founding-father effect in propagation of these mutant chromosomes \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 15}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 65, "end": 80}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 87, "end": 121}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 136, "end": 164}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 954, "end": 961}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1235, "end": 1242}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1522, "end": 1537}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D017825"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D017825"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D007966"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D017825"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D017825"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D017825"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D017825"}]}
