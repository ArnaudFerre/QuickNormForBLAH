We identified the alpha-cardiac actin gene (ACTC) as a novel disease gene in a pedigree suffering from familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC). Linkage analyses excluded all the previously reported FHC loci as possible disease loci in the family studied, with lod scores varying between -2. 5 and -6. 0 0. Further linkage analyses of plausible candidate genes highly expressed in the adult human heart identified ACTC as the most likely disease gene, showing a maximal lod score of 3. 6 6. Mutation analysis of ACTC revealed an Ala295Ser mutation in exon 5 close to 2 missense mutations recently described to cause the inherited form of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC). \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 47, "end": 83}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 188, "end": 224}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 226, "end": 229}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 286, "end": 289}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 725, "end": 758}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 760, "end": 763}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D024741"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D024741"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D024741"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D024741"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "C536277"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "C536277"}]}
