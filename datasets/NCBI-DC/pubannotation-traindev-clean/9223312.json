Chromosomal translocations identified in hematopoietic and solid tumors result in deregulated expression of protooncogenes or creation of chimeric proteins with tumorigenic potential. In the pediatric solid tumor alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a consistent t (2; 13) (q35; q14) or variant t (1; 13) (p36; q14) translocation generates PAX3-FKHR or PAX7-FKHR fusion proteins, respectively. In this report, we demonstrate that in addition to functional alterations these translocations are associated with fusion product overexpression. Furthermore, PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR overexpression occurs by distinct mechanisms. Transcription of PAX3-FKHR is increased relative to wild-type PAX3 by a copy number-independent process. In contrast, PAX7-FKHR overexpression results from fusion gene amplification. Thus, gene-specific mechanisms were selected to overexpress PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, presumably due to differences in regulation between the wild-type loci. We postulate that these overexpression mechanisms ensure a critical level of gene product for the oncogenic effects of these fusions.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-dev", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 116, "end": 141}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 184, "end": 214}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 344, "end": 355}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 356, "end": 381}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1026, "end": 1051}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D018232"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D019337"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D018232"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D018232"}]}
