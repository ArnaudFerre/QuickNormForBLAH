Transporter-facilitated uptake of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) has been implicated in anxiety in humans and animal models and is the site of action of widely used uptake-inhibiting antidepressant and antianxiety drugs. Human 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) gene transcription is modulated by a common polymorphism in its upstream regulatory region. The short variant of the polymorphism reduces the transcriptional efficiency of the 5-HTT gene promoter, resulting in decreased 5-HTT expression and 5-HT uptake in lymphoblasts. Association studies in two independent samples totaling 505 individuals revealed that the 5-HTT polymorphism accounts for 3 to 4 percent of total variation and 7 to 9 percent of inherited variance in anxiety-related personality traits in individuals as well as sibships.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-dev", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 15, "end": 37}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 208, "end": 215}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 842, "end": 876}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D001008"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D001008"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D001008"}]}
