The EWS gene has been identified based on its location at the chromosome 22 breakpoint of the t (11; 22) (q24; q12) translocation that characterizes Ewing sarcoma and related neuroectodermal tumors. The EWS gene spans about 40 kb of DNA and is encoded by 17 exons. The nucleotide sequence of the exons is identical to that of the previously described cDNA. The first 7 exons encode the N-terminal domain of EWS, which consists of a repeated degenerated polypeptide of 7 to 12 residues rich in tyrosine, serine, threonine, glycine, and glutamine. Exons 11, 12, and 13 encode the putative RNA binding domain. The three glycine- and arginine-rich motifs of the gene are mainly encoded by exons 8-9, 14, and 16. The DNA sequence in the 5 region of the gene has features of a CpG-rich island and lacks canonical promoter elements, such as TATA and CCAAT consensus sequences. Positions of the chromosome 22 breakpoints were determined for 19 Ewing tumors. They were localized in introns 7 or 8 in 18 cases and in intron 10 in 1 case.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 75, "end": 80}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 267, "end": 280}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 293, "end": 315}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 1054, "end": 1066}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D012512"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D017599"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D012512"}]}
