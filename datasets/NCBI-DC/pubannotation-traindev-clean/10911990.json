The mechanism by which (CTG) n expansion in the 3 UTR of the DMPK gene causes myotonic dystrophy (DM) is unknown. We identified four RNA splicing factors--hnRNP C, U2AF (U2 auxiliary factor), PTB (polypyrimidine tract binding protein), and PSF (PTB associated splicing factor) --that bind to two short regions 3 of the (CUG) n, and found a novel 3 DMPK exon resulting in an mRNA lacking the repeats. We propose that the (CUG) n is an essential cis acting element for this splicing event. In contrast to (CUG) n containing mRNAs, the novel isoform is not retained in the nucleus in DM cells, resulting in imbalances in relative levels of cytoplasmic DMPK mRNA isoforms and a new dominant effect of the mutation on DMPK.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 18}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 217, "end": 235}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 237, "end": 239}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 720, "end": 722}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D009223"}]}
