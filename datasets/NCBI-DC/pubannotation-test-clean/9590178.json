Products of steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) and Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) genes are essential for mammalian gonadogenesis prior to sexual differentiation. In males, SF-1 participates in sexual development by regulating expression of the polypeptide hormone Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS). Here, we show that WT1 -KTS isoforms associate and synergize with SF-1 to promote MIS expression. In contrast, WT1 missense mutations, associated with male pseudohermaphroditism in Denys-Drash syndrome, fail to synergize with SF-1. Additionally, the X-linked, candidate dosage-sensitive sex-reversal gene, Dax-1, antagonizes synergy between SF-1 and WT1, most likely through a direct interaction with SF-1. We propose that WT1 and Dax-1 functionally oppose each other in testis development by modulating SF-1-mediated transactivation.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 12}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 146, "end": 157}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 538, "end": 564}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 568, "end": 588}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D009396"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D009396"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D058490"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D030321"}]}
