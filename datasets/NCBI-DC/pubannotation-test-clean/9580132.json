Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (FNDI) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by deficiency in the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) encoded by the AVP-neurophysin II (AVP-NPII) gene on chromosome 20p13. In this study, we analyzed two families with FNDI using direct automated fluorescent, solid phase, single-stranded DNA sequencing of PCR-amplified AVP-NPII DNA. In one of the families, affected individuals presented a novel nonsense mutation in exon 3 of the gene, consisting in a G to T transition at nucleotide 2101, which produces a stop signal in codon 82 (Glu) of NPII. The premature termination eliminates part of the C-terminal domain of NPII, including a cysteine residue in position 85, which could be involved in the correct folding of the prohormone. In the second family, a G279A substitution at position -1 of the signal peptide was observed in all affected individuals. This missense mutation, which replaces Ala with Thr, is frequent among FNDI patients and is thought to reduce the efficiency of cleavage by signal peptidases.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 140, "end": 184}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 186, "end": 230}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 232, "end": 236}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 244, "end": 270}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 463, "end": 467}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1173, "end": 1177}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "OMIM:125700"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "OMIM:125700"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "OMIM:125700"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D030342"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "OMIM:125700"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "OMIM:125700"}]}
