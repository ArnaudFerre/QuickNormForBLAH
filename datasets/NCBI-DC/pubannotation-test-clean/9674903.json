Maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) for chromosome 15 is responsible for an estimated 30% of cases of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We report on an unusual case of maternal disomy 15 in PWS that is most consistent with adjacent-1 segregation of a paternal t (3; 15) (p25; q11. 2) with simultaneous maternal meiotic nondisjunction for chromosome 15. The patient (J. B.), a 17-year-old white male with PWS, was found to have 47 chromosomes with a supernumerary, paternal der (15) consisting of the short arm and the proximal long arm of chromosome 15, and distal chromosome arm 3p. The t (3; 15) was present in the balanced state in the patients father and a sister. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that the PWS critical region resided on the derivative chromosome 3 and that there was no deletion of the PWS region on the normal pair of 15s present in J. B. Methylation analysis at exon alpha of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated polypeptide N (SNRPN) gene showed a pattern characteristic of only the maternal chromosome 15 in J. B. Maternal disomy was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis of microsatellite repeats at the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor beta3 subunit (GABRB3) locus. A niece (B. B.) with 45 chromosomes and the derivative 3 but without the der (15) demonstrated a phenotype consistent with that reported for haploinsufficiency of distal 3 p. Uniparental disomy associated with unbalanced segregation of non-Robertsonian translocations has been reported previously but has not, to our knowledge, been observed in a case of PWS. Furthermore, our findings are best interpreted as true gamete complementation resulting in maternal UPD 15 and PWS \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 15}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 20, "end": 41}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 137, "end": 188}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 237, "end": 258}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 260, "end": 263}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 298, "end": 316}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 320, "end": 323}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 534, "end": 537}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 864, "end": 867}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 961, "end": 964}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 1203, "end": 1218}}, {"id": "T12", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 1542, "end": 1560}}, {"id": "T13", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1722, "end": 1725}}, {"id": "T14", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1818, "end": 1833}}, {"id": "T15", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1838, "end": 1841}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D024182"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "C538037"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "C538037"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T10", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T11", "obj": "D024182"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A12", "subj": "T12", "obj": "D024182"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A13", "subj": "T13", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A14", "subj": "T14", "obj": "C538037"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A15", "subj": "T15", "obj": "D011218"}]}
