A gene encoding a novel transmembrane protein was identified by DNA sequence analysis within the insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) locus IDDM4 on chromosome 11q13. Based on its chromosomal position, this gene is a candidate for conferring susceptibility to diabetes. The gene, termed low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 5 (LRP5), encodes a protein of 1615 amino acids that contains conserved modules which are characteristic of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family. These modules include a putative signal peptide for protein export, four epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats with associated spacer domains, three LDL-receptor (LDLR) repeats, a single transmembrane spanning domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. The encoded protein has a unique organization of EGF and LDLR repeats; therefore, LRP5 likely represents a new category of the LDLR family. Both human and mouse LRP5 cDNAs have been isolated and the encoded mature proteins are 95% identical, indicating a high degree of evolutionary conservation.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 171, "end": 206}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 208, "end": 212}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 340, "end": 348}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D003922"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D003922"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D003920"}]}
