Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) studies with distal 11p13 specific cosmids showed that the chromosome 11 breakpoint lay between the aniridia (PAX6) locus and a region approximately 100 kb distal to PAX6 defined by the cosmid FO2121. Although this patient did not have a detectable deletion within PAX6, her aniridia may have resulted from a disruption of the distal chromatin domain containing either enhancers or regulators for PAX6. This case may therefore be another example of aniridia caused by a position effect as recently described in two familial aniridia patients in which the phenotype cosegregated with chromosome abnormalities with 11p13 breakpoints.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 31, "end": 48}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 111, "end": 138}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 396, "end": 404}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 571, "end": 579}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 745, "end": 753}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 811, "end": 828}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 879, "end": 903}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D015783"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D015783"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D015783"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D015783"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D015783"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D015783"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D002869"}]}
