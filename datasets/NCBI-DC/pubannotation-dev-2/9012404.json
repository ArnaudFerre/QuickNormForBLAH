Nine (17%) of the patients had a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer in at least one first-degree relative. A further seven (13%) of the patients reported breast/ovarian cancer in at least one second-degree relative and in no first-degree relatives. No germ-line BRCA1 mutations were found. Two male breast cancer patients (4% of the total) were found to carry novel truncating mutations in the BRCA2 gene. Only one of the two male breast cancer patients carrying a BRCA2 mutation had a family history of cancer, with one case of ovarian cancer in a first-degree relative. The remaining eight cases (89%) of male breast cancer with a family history of breast/ovarian cancer in first-degree relatives remain unaccounted for by mutations in either the BRCA1 gene or the BRCA2 gene.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 60}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 106, "end": 124}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 201, "end": 232}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 308, "end": 336}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 423, "end": 444}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 563, "end": 581}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 695, "end": 713}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 773, "end": 779}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 798, "end": 812}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 876, "end": 894}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 920, "end": 941}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D018567"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D018567"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D061325"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D061325"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D061325"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D018567"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D018567"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D010051"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T10", "obj": "D018567"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T11", "obj": "D061325"}]}
