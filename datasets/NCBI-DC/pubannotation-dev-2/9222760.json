The most common variant of GALT, the Duarte variant, occurs as two types, Duarte-1 (D-1) and Duarte-2 (D-2), both of which carry the sequence change N314D. D-1 increases, whereas D-2 decreases GALT activity. To study the molecular genetics of classical and Duarte galactosemia, we analyzed the GALT mutations in 30 families with classical galactosemia, in 10 families with the D-2 variant and in 3 individuals carrying the D-1 allele by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). DGGE detected 59 of the 60 classical galactosemia alleles. Q188R accounted for 60%, K285N accounted for 28% of these alleles. Eight novel candidate galactosemia mutations were found. On all D-2 alleles N314D occurred in cis with two intronic sequence changes, on the D-1 alleles in cis with a neutral mutation in exon 7. We conclude that the mutations causing galactosemia are highly heterogeneous and that K285N is a second common galactosemia mutation in our population.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 27, "end": 60}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 123, "end": 147}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 531, "end": 564}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 617, "end": 639}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 810, "end": 822}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 921, "end": 933}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1133, "end": 1145}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1205, "end": 1217}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D005693"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D005693"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D005693"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D005693"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D005693"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D005693"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D005693"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D005693"}]}
