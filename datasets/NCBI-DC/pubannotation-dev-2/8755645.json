A distinct intronic nucleotide sequence, known as the branchpoint region, plays a central role in this process. We here describe a point mutation in such a sequence. Three sisters were shown to suffer from fish-eye disease (FED), a disorder which is caused by mutations in the gene coding for lecithin  cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). Sequencing of the LCAT gene of all three probands revealed compound heterozygosity for a missense mutation in exon 4 which is reported to underlie the FED phenotype, and a point mutation located in intron 4 (IVS4  T-22C). By performing in vitro expression of LCAT minigenes and reverse transcriptase PCR on mRNA isolated from leukocytes of the patient, this gene defect was shown to cause a null allele as the result of complete intron retention. In conclusion, we demonstrated that a point mutation in a lariat branchpoint consensus sequence causes a null allele in a patient with FED. In addition, our finding illustrates the importance of this sequence for normal human mRNA processing. Finally, this report provides a widely applicable strategy which ensures fast and effective screening for intronic defects that underlie differential gene expression.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 78, "end": 102}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 104, "end": 120}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 454, "end": 470}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 471, "end": 475}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 738, "end": 741}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1169, "end": 1172}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D030342"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D007863"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D007863"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D007863"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D007863"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D007863"}]}
