We have identified WASP, the protein that is defective in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), as a novel effector for CDC42Hs, but not for the other Rho family members, Rac and Rho. This interaction is dependent on the presence of the G protein-binding domain. Cellular expression of epitope-tagged WASP produces clusters of WASP that are highly enriched in polymerized actin. This clustering is not observed with a C-terminally deleted WASP and is inhibited by coexpression with dominant negative CDC42Hs-N17, but not with dominant negative forms of Rac or Rho. Thus, WASP provides a novel link between CDC42Hs and the actin cytoskeleton, which suggests a molecular mechanism for many of the cellular abnormalities in WAS. The WASP sequence contains two novel domains that are homologous to other proteins involved in action organization.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 24}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 280, "end": 304}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 305, "end": 309}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 937, "end": 940}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D014923"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D014923"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D014923"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D014923"}]}
