This question is of particular interest for the human enzyme galactose-l-phosphate uridylyl-transferase (GALT), impairment of which results in the inherited metabolic disorder galactosemia, because many if not most patients studied to date are compound heterozygotes rather than true molecular homozygotes. Furthermore, the broad range of phenotypic severity observed in these patients raises the possibility that allelic combination, not just allelic constitution, may play some role in determining outcome. In the work described herein, we have selected two distinct naturally occurring null mutations of GALT, Q188R and R333W, and asked the questions (i) what are the impacts of these mutations on subunit assembly, and (ii) if heterodimers do form, are they active ? To answer these questions, we have established a yeast system for the coexpression of epitope-tagged alleles of human GALT and investigated both the extent of specific GALT subunit interactions and the activity of defined heterodimer pools. We have found that both homodimers and heterodimers do form involving each of the mutant subunits tested and that both heterodimer pools retain substantial enzymatic activity. These results are significant not only in terms of their implications for furthering our understanding of galactosemia and GALT holoenzyme structure-function relationships but also because the system described may serve as a model for similar studies of other complexes composed of multiple subunits.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 432, "end": 460}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 461, "end": 473}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1579, "end": 1591}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D008659"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D005693"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D005693"}]}
