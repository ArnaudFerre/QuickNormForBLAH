Here, we report that a mutation predicting the substitution of Gly 230 by glutamic acid (G230E) between segments D3 and D4 dramatically alters the pore properties of a recombinant human muscle Cl- channel (hCIC-1) expressed in a mammalian cell line (tsA201). The G230E mutation causes substantial changes in anion and cation selectivity as well as a fundamental change in rectification of the current-voltage relationship. Whereas wild-type channels are characterized by pronounced inward rectification and a Cl > thiocyanate > Br > NO (3) > I > CH (3) SO (3) selectivity, G230E exhibits outward rectification at positive potentials and a thiocyanate > NO (3) > I > Br > Cl > CH (3) SO (3) selectivity. Furthermore, the cation-to-anion permeability ratio of the mutant is much greater than that of the wild-type channel. Voltage-dependent blocks by intracellular and extracellular iodide help to distinguish two distinct ion binding sites within the hClC-1 conduction pathway. Both binding sites are preserved in the mutant but have decreased affinities for iodide. These findings suggest that Gly 230 is critical for normal ion conductance in hClC-1 and that this residue resides within the channel pore.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 14, "end": 51}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 107, "end": 146}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 153, "end": 190}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "OMIM:160800"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "OMIM:160800"}]}
