Many different mutations occur in BRCA1, including several examples of recurrent mutations, each of which accounts for a significant number of families with heritable cancer predisposition. These common mutations have an etiological role in many breast and ovarian cancer cases and provide the opportunity to examine genotype-phenotype correlations and genotype-environment interactions in individuals with the identical BRCA1 lesion. We report a novel missense change in BRCA1, 2640 C-- > T (R841W), found in 3 cases from a subject group of 305 breast and 79 ovarian cancer cases from Orange County, CA. These are consecutive, population-based cases not selected for age or family history. In all three cases, there is a strong family history of breast, ovarian, or other cancers possibly related to a BRCA1 defect and family members showed a high concordance of cancer incidence with the presence of R841W. The age of cancer onset was not always distinct from typical sporadic cases. Testing of a sample of 413 unrelated individuals to examine the hypothesis that R841W might be a rare polymorphism detected one additional instance in a woman with breast cancer diagnosed at age 77 years, and cancer in one parent. R841W is likely to be an etiologically significant lesion with involvement in close to 1% (95% confidence interval of 0-1. 7%) of all breast and ovarian cancers in this population. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 121, "end": 146}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 342, "end": 348}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 421, "end": 446}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 721, "end": 749}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 922, "end": 955}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1039, "end": 1045}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1095, "end": 1101}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1325, "end": 1338}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 1370, "end": 1376}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 1526, "end": 1552}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D001943"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D009369"}]}
