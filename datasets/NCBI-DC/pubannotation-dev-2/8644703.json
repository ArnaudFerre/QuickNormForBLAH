UKCCCR Familial Ovarian Cancer Study Group.\n\nGerm-line mutations of the BRCA1 gene are responsible for a substantial proportion of families with multiple cases of early-onset breast and/or ovarian cancer. Since the isolation of BRCA1 last year, > 65 distinct mutations scattered throughout the coding region have been detected, making analysis of the gene time consuming and technically challenging. We have developed a multiplex heteroduplex analysis that is designed to analyze one-quarter of the coding sequence in a single-step screening procedure and that will detect approximately 50% of all BRCA1 mutations so far reported in breast/ovarian cancer families. We have used this technique to analyze BRCA1 in 162 families with a history of breast and/or ovarian cancer and identified 12 distinct mutations in 35 families.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 118, "end": 132}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 277, "end": 305}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 735, "end": 756}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 846, "end": 874}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D010051"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "OMIM:604370"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "OMIM:604370"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "OMIM:604370"}]}
