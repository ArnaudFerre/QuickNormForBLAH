In order to test this hypothesis, we have studied samples of single sperm from three individuals heterozygous at the DM locus, each with one allele larger and one allele smaller than 19 CTG repeats. To guard against the possible problem of differential PCR amplification rates based on the lengths of the alleles, the sperm were also typed at another closely linked marker whose allele size was unrelated to the allele size at the DM locus. Using statistical models specifically designed to study single-sperm segregation data, we find no evidence of meiotic segregation distortion. The upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the estimate of the common segregation probability for the three donors is at or below. 515 for all models considered, and no statistically significant difference from. 5 is detected in any of the models. This suggests that any greater amount of segregation distortion at the myotonic dystrophy locus must result from events following sperm ejaculation. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 81, "end": 99}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 129, "end": 147}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 148, "end": 151}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 267, "end": 269}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 442, "end": 444}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 756, "end": 758}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1245, "end": 1263}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D009223"}]}
