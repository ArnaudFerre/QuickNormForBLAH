Codon 344 is a key residue within the tetramerisation domain, and the amino acid substitution of a proline for a leucine is predicted to have profound implications for tetramerisation and potentially DNA binding. This is the first report of a mutation at this residue in either sporadic tumours or in the germline and the first report of a germline mutation within the tetramerisation domain. The family does not appear to be remarkable in the spectrum of tumours, and there is loss of the wild-type allele in a leiomyosarcoma from the proband. A cell line has been established from the tumour of the proband and cytogenetic and molecular studies carried out, providing an extensive analysis in this family.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 93, "end": 113}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 159, "end": 179}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 229, "end": 235}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 536, "end": 552}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 714, "end": 721}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 770, "end": 784}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 845, "end": 851}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D016864"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D016864"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D007890"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D009369"}]}
