All but one of the mutations are predicted to give rise to premature translation termination and include seven frameshift insertions or deletions, a nonsense mutation, and a splice acceptor site mutation. The remaining mutation is a missense mutation (Cys61Gly) in the zinc-binding motif. Four novel Swedish founding mutations were identified  the nucleotide 2595 deletion A was found in five families, the C 1806 T nonsense mutation in three families, the 3166 insertion TGAGA in three families, and the nucleotide 1201 deletion 11 in two families. Analysis of the intragenic polymorphism D17S855 supports common origins of the mutations. Eleven of the 15 kindreds manifesting BRCA1 mutations were breast-ovarian cancer families, several of them with a predominant ovarian cancer phenotype. The set of 32 families in which no BRCA1 alterations were detected included 1 breast-ovarian cancer kindred manifesting clear linkage to the BRCA1 region and loss of the wild-type chromosome in associated tumors. Other tumor types found in BRCA1 mutation/haplotype carriers included prostatic, pancreas, skin, and lung cancer, a malignant melanoma, an oligodendroglioma, and a carcinosarcoma. In all, 12 of 16 kindreds manifesting BRCA1 mutation or linkage contained ovarian cancer, as compared with only 6 of the remaining 31 families (P <. 001). The present study confirms the involvement of BRCA1 in disease predisposition for a subset of hereditary breast cancer families often characterized by ovarian cancers. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 28, "end": 64}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 134, "end": 159}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1096, "end": 1117}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1163, "end": 1177}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1267, "end": 1288}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 1394, "end": 1400}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1408, "end": 1413}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 1472, "end": 1514}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1518, "end": 1536}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1541, "end": 1558}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1566, "end": 1580}}, {"id": "T12", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1656, "end": 1670}}, {"id": "T13", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1831, "end": 1855}}, {"id": "T14", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1888, "end": 1903}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D061325"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D061325"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D061325"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D010051"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D061325"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D008545"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T10", "obj": "D009837"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T11", "obj": "D002296"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T12", "obj": "D010051"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A12", "subj": "T13", "obj": "D001943"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A13", "subj": "T14", "obj": "D010051"}]}
