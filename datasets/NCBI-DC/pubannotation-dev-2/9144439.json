In the Japanese population, however, there has been no report demonstrating the contribution of IDDM2 to the pathogenesis of IDDM. We conducted an association study of IDDM in a large number of Japanese subjects with multiple polymorphisms in INS region. We found a significant association of the INS region with IDDM. Alleles positively associated with IDDM in INS region were the same as those positively-associated with IDDM in Caucasian population, although positively-associated alleles are very common (allele frequencies > 0. 9) in the Japanese general population. These data suggest that IDDM2 is involved in the genetic susceptibility to IDDM in Japanese. The high frequencies of disease-associated alleles in the general population suggest that IDDM2 locus is not responsible for the low incidence of IDDM in Japanese. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 95, "end": 130}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 247, "end": 282}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 423, "end": 427}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 466, "end": 470}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 611, "end": 615}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 652, "end": 656}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 721, "end": 725}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 945, "end": 949}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1109, "end": 1113}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "OMIM:125852"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "OMIM:125852"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D003922"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D003922"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D003922"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D003922"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D003922"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D003922"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D003922"}]}
