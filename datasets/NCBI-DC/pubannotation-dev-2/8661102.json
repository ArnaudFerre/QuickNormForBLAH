The entire coding sequence of the Atm transcript was cloned and found to contain an open reading frame encoding a protein of 3066 amino acids with 84% overall identity and 91% similarity to the human ATM protein. Variable levels of expression of Atm were observed in different tissues. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and linkage analysis located the Atm gene on mouse chromosome 9, band 9C, in a region homologous to the ATM region on human chromosome 11q22-q23.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 77, "end": 98}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 164, "end": 185}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 186, "end": 189}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D001260"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D001260"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D001260"}]}
