No inherited form of GPI-anchor deficiency has been described. Because conventional Piga gene knockout is associated with high embryonic lethality in chimeric mice, we used the Cre/loxP system. We generated mice in which two loxP sites flank part of Piga exon 2. After crossbreeding with female mice of the EIIa-cre strain, the floxed allele undergoes Cre-mediated recombination with high efficiency during early embryonic development. Because of X chromosome inactivation, female offspring are mosaic for cells that express or lack GPI-linked proteins. Analysis of mosaic mice showed that in heart, lung, kidney, brain, and liver, mainly wild-type Piga is active, suggesting that these tissues require GPI-linked proteins. The salient exceptions were spleen, thymus, and red blood cells, which had almost equal numbers of cells expressing the wild-type or the recombined allele, implying that GPI-linked proteins are not essential for the derivation of these tissues. PIGA (-) cells had no growth advantage, suggesting that other factors are needed for their clonal dominance in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": "160", "end": "228"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "263", "end": "298"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "321", "end": "342"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "427", "end": "446"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1394", "end": "1429"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "C537277"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D006457"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "C537277"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D020964"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D006457"}]}
