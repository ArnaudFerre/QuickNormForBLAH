In both families, the proteolipid protein (PLP) gene in the single affected male could be traced back to his unaffected maternal grandfather. Therefore, each family contains a new mutation. In the case of the prenatal diagnosis, the fetus was shown by cytogenetic analysis to be a female, who we predict will be a noncarrier of PMD based on her genotype with the PLP intragenic polymorphism.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "44", "end": "72"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "270", "end": "307"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "309", "end": "312"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "643", "end": "646"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "OMIM:312080"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "OMIM:312080"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "OMIM:312080"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "OMIM:312080"}]}
