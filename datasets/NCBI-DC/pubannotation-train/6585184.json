Families in which there is at least one obligatory female heterozygote (n = 13). Here prediction and exclusion of DMD gene transmission may be possible, the accuracy being dependent on the closeness of the linkage of the DNA marker (s) to the DMD gene; an illustrative case is reported. Families in which there is a single affected boy, who also has one or more healthy brothers (n = 26). Given an informative restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), the probability that the boy represents a new mutation can be reassessed; it is also possible to exclude the DMD gene in a sister. Families with a single affected boy with no brother (n = 30). Here exclusion of the DMD gene in a sister may be possible. Only in one family was there no possibility of useful linkage analysis. The linkage analysis required is described, and the need to check DMD families for informative RFLPs is stressed. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "51", "end": "78"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "102", "end": "129"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "131", "end": "134"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "310", "end": "313"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "434", "end": "437"}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "563", "end": "566"}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "888", "end": "891"}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "994", "end": "997"}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "1170", "end": "1173"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D020388"}]}
