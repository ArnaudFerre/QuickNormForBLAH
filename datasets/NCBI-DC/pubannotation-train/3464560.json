X-specific restriction fragment length polymorphisms are used to establish DNA haplotypes in three-generation DMD families. From the proportion of DMD patients who have inherited their maternal grandfathers X chromosome, the ratio of mutation rates can be calculated. In contrast to classical methods, the proposed procedure is not restricted to sporadic or familiar cases nor is any information on the carrier status of female relatives required.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "113", "end": "140"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "241", "end": "268"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "270", "end": "273"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "386", "end": "389"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "423", "end": "426"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D020388"}]}
