We have previously identified the protein product of the nm23-H1 gene in two-dimensional electrophoretic gels and have designated it p19/nm23. In neuroblastoma, higher levels of p19/nm23, which are associated with amplification of the N-myc oncogene, large tumor mass, and metastasis, were observed in advanced stage tumors compared with limited stage disease. Because of the variable expression of nm23-H1 in different tumors, we have investigated the relationship between amounts of the protein and cell proliferation. The levels of p19/nm23 were compared between resting and mitotically stimulated normal human PBLs and in leukemia cells. The amount of p19/nm23 increased in normal lymphocytes in response to mitotic stimulation and paralleled the increase in DNA synthesis. In leukemia cells obtained from patients with different subtypes of acute leukemia, p19/nm23 levels were also increased relative to resting normal lymphocytes. Treatment of mitotically stimulated lymphocytes with cyclosporin, which inhibits proliferation, blocked the increase in p19/nm23; treatment of the leukemia cell line HL-60 with dimethylsulfoxide, which induces terminal differentiation, resulted in diminished levels of p19/nm23. Our data therefore provide evidence that nm23-H1 expression is related to cell proliferative activity.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": "233", "end": "239"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "405", "end": "418"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "516", "end": "521"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": "576", "end": "582"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": "679", "end": "685"}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "885", "end": "893"}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "1040", "end": "1048"}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1105", "end": "1119"}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "1344", "end": "1352"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D009447"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D007938"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D007938"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D007938"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D007938"}]}
