The control group consisted of 40 consecutive FMF patients, who arrived at the FMF clinic for their regular follow-up visit and were 40 years of age or older at the time of the examination. The severity of the disease in patients and controls was determined using a modified score, developed previously. Mutational analysis in the FMF gene was performed using a commercial kit. Only 20 of 4000 (0. 5%) patients had late-onset FMF. These patients were mostly men, of non-North African origin, P < 0. 05 compared to controls. All had abdominal attacks and in most these were the only manifestation of their disease, P < 0. 001 001. None had chronic or prolonged manifestations of FMF, for example, amyloidosis, chronic arthritis, or protracted myalgia, P < 0. 001. The response to treatment was good despite using low colchicine dose, P < 0. 05. The overall severity score indicated a mild disease, P < 0. 001. Mutational analysis revealed absence of M694V homozygosity, P < 0. 01, compared to our regular FMF population. We conclude that the onset of FMF in a late age defines a milder form of disease with typical clinical, demographic, and molecular genetic characteristics \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "11", "end": "39"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "41", "end": "44"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "224", "end": "252"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "254", "end": "257"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "312", "end": "315"}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "402", "end": "405"}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "506", "end": "509"}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "539", "end": "542"}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "791", "end": "794"}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "886", "end": "889"}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1138", "end": "1141"}}, {"id": "T12", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1156", "end": "1167"}}, {"id": "T13", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1169", "end": "1186"}}, {"id": "T14", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1202", "end": "1209"}}, {"id": "T15", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "1464", "end": "1467"}}, {"id": "T16", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1510", "end": "1513"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D010505"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D010505"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D010505"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D010505"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D010505"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D010505"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D010505"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D010505"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D010505"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T10", "obj": "D010505"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T11", "obj": "D010505"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A12", "subj": "T12", "obj": "D000686"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A13", "subj": "T13", "obj": "D001168"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A14", "subj": "T14", "obj": "D059352"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A15", "subj": "T15", "obj": "D010505"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A16", "subj": "T16", "obj": "D010505"}]}
