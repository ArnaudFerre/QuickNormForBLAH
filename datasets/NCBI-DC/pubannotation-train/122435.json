Cells from patient 1 had 5% of control levels of acid lipase, using 14C-triolein as substrate; however, when artificial substrates (esters of 4-methylumbelliferone and p-nitrophenol) were used to measure acid lipase, these cells had 30% of control levels. Electrophoresis of cell extracts revealed the absence of the A form of acid lipase, consistent with the diagnosis of Wolman disease. Analysis of fetal tissues following prostaglandin termination of this pregnancy confirmed the diagnosis. Assay of fetal-skin fibroblasts with 14C-triolein, as well as with artificial substrates, showed marked deficiency of acid lipase activity. Electrophoresis of fetal-tissue extracts also demonstrated the absence of the A form of acid lipase. Amniotic-fluid cells from patient 2 showed normal levels of acid lipase with all substrates tested; the electrophoretic pattern of acid lipase was normal. The results suggest that the prenatal diagnosis of Wolman disease be made using the radioassay of acid lipase and/or electrophoresis.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "22", "end": "36"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "66", "end": "80"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "547", "end": "561"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1115", "end": "1129"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D015223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D015223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D015223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D015223"}]}
