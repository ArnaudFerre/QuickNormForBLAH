A relatively high frequency of carriers (1/27) of a lethal, infantile form of the disease is found in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, but it is not yet evident whether this has resulted from a founder effect and random genetic drift or from a selective advantage of heterozygotes. We have identified a single-base mutation in a cloned fragment of the HEXA gene from an Ashkenazi Jewish patient. This change, the substitution of a C for G in the first nucleotide of intron 12 is expected to result in defective splicing of the messenger RNA. A test for the mutant allele based on amplification of DNA by the polymerase chain rection and cleavage of a DdeI restriction site generated by the mutation revealed that this case and two other cases of the Ashkenazi, infantile form of Tay-Sachs disease are heterozygous for two different mutations. The occurrence of multiple mutant alleles warrants further examination of the selective advantage hypothesis.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "54", "end": "71"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "73", "end": "90"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": "97", "end": "133"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1046", "end": "1063"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D013661"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D013661"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D030342"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D013661"}]}
