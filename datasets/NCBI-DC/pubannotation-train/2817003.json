No other clinical characteristics often associated with the deletion of 11p13 were observed in this family. This finding, in association with 3 other instances of single breaks at 11p13 and aniridia, supports the assignment of AN2 to 11p13. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "58", "end": "75"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "104", "end": "121"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "441", "end": "449"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D015783"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D015783"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D015783"}]}
