A full-length human PAH cDNA sequence has been inserted into pzip-neoSV (X), which is a retroviral vector containing the bacterial neo gene. The recombinant has been transfected into psi 2 cells, which provide synthesis of the retroviral capsid. Recombinant virus was detected in the culture medium of the transfected psi 2 cells, which is capable of transmitting the human PAH gene into mouse NIH 3T3 cells by infection leading to stable incorporation of the recombinant provirus. Infected cells express PAH mRNA, immunoreactive PAH protein, and exhibit pterin-dependent phenylalanine hydroxylase activity. The recombinant virus is also capable of infecting a mouse hepatoma cell line that does not normally synthesize PAH. PAH activity is present in the cellular extracts and the entire hydroxylation system is reconstituted in the hepatoma cells infected with the recombinant viruses. Thus, recombinant viruses containing human PAH cDNA provide a means for introducing functional PAH into mammalian cells of hepatic origin and can potentially be introduced into whole animals as a model for somatic gene therapy for PKU.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "86", "end": "94"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "102", "end": "117"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "119", "end": "122"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "137", "end": "195"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "870", "end": "878"}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "1037", "end": "1045"}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1322", "end": "1325"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D006528"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D010661"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D010661"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "OMIM:261600"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D006528"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D006528"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D010661"}]}
