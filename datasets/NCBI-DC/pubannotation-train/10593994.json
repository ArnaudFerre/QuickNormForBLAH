{"target": "http://pubannotation.org/docs/sourcedb/PubMed/sourceid/10593994", "sourcedb": "PubMed", "sourceid": "10593994", "text": "Mutations of the cathepsin C gene are responsible for Papillon-Lefevre syndrome.\n\nPapillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and severe early onset periodontitis that results in the premature loss of the primary and secondary dentitions. A major gene locus for PLS has been mapped to a 2. 8 cM interval on chromosome 11q14. Correlation of physical and genetic maps of this interval indicate it includes at least 40 ESTs and six known genes including the lysosomal protease cathepsin C gene (CTSC). The CTSC message is expressed at high levels in a variety of immune cells including polymorphonuclear leucocytes, macrophages, and their precursors. By RT-PCR, we found CTSC is also expressed in epithelial regions commonly affected by PLS, including the palms, soles, knees, and oral keratinised gingiva. The 4. 7 kb CTSC gene consists of two exons. Sequence analysis of CTSC from subjects affected with PLS from five consanguineous Turkish families identified four different mutations. An exon 1 nonsense mutation (856C-- > T) introduces a premature stop codon at amino acid 286. Three exon 2 mutations were identified, including a single nucleotide deletion (2692delA) of codon 349 introducing a frameshift and premature termination codon, a 2 bp deletion (2673-2674delCT) that results in introduction of a stop codon at amino acid 343, and a G-- > A substitution in codon 429 (2931G-- > A) introducing a premature termination codon. All PLS patients were homozygous for cathepsin C mutations inherited from a common ancestor. Parents and sibs heterozygous for cathepsin C mutations do not show either the palmoplantar hyperkeratosis or severe early onset periodontitis characteristic of PLS. A more complete understanding of the functional physiology of cathepsin C carries significant implications for understanding normal and abnormal skin development and periodontal disease susceptibility \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "54", "end": "79"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "81", "end": "106"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "108", "end": "111"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": "119", "end": "147"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "165", "end": "192"}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "216", "end": "229"}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "329", "end": "332"}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "801", "end": "804"}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "970", "end": "973"}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "1506", "end": "1509"}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1674", "end": "1701"}}, {"id": "T12", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1724", "end": "1737"}}, {"id": "T13", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1756", "end": "1759"}}, {"id": "T14", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "1927", "end": "1946"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D010214"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D010214"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D010214"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D030342"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D007645"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D010518"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D010214"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D010214"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D010214"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T10", "obj": "D010214"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T11", "obj": "D007645"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A12", "subj": "T12", "obj": "D010518"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A13", "subj": "T13", "obj": "D010214"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A14", "subj": "T14", "obj": "D010510"}]}
