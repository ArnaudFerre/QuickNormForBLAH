The enzymatic defect leads to the systemic accumulation of neutral glycosphingolipids with terminal alpha-galactosyl moieties. Clinically, affected hemizygous males have angiokeratoma, severe acroparesthesia, renal failure, and vasculopathy of the heart and brain. While demonstration of alpha-galactosidase deficiency in leukocytes is diagnostic in affected males, enzymatic detection of female carriers is often inconclusive, due to random X-chromosomal inactivation, underlining the need of molecular investigations for accurate genetic counseling. By use of chemical cleavage of mismatches adapted to fluorescence-based detection systems, we have characterized the mutations underlying alpha-Gal A deficiency in 16 individuals from six unrelated families with FD. The mutational spectrum included five missense mutations (C202W, C223G, N224D, R301Q, and Q327K) and one splice-site mutation [IVS3 G (-1) -- > C]. Studies at the mRNA level showed that the latter led to altered pre-mRNA splicing with consequent alteration of the mRNA translational reading frame and generation of a premature termination codon of translation. By use of this strategy, carrier status was accurately assessed in all seven at-risk females tested, whereas enzymatic dosages failed to diagnose or exclude heterozygosity.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "0", "end": "13"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "158", "end": "171"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "173", "end": "175"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "178", "end": "209"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": "217", "end": "270"}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "510", "end": "523"}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "525", "end": "547"}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "549", "end": "562"}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": "568", "end": "603"}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "628", "end": "658"}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1030", "end": "1052"}}, {"id": "T12", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1104", "end": "1106"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D000795"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D000795"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D000795"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D000795"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D008052"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D000794"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D010292"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D051437"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D014652"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T10", "obj": "D000795"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T11", "obj": "D000795"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A12", "subj": "T12", "obj": "D000795"}]}
