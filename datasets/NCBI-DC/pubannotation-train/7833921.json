It is a benign condition which is believed to result from deficiency of hepatic fructokinase (ketohexokinase, KHK, E. C. 2. 7. 1. 3). This enzyme catalyses the first step of metabolism of dietary fructose, conversion of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate. Despite the early recognition of this disorder, the primary structure of human KHK and the molecular basis of essential fructosuria have not been previously defined. In this report, the isolation and sequencing of full-length cDNA clones encoding human ketohexokinase are described. Alternative mRNA species and alternative KHK isozymes are produced by alternative polyadenylation and splicing of the KHK gene. The KHK proteins show a high level of sequence conservation relative to rat KHK. Direct evidence that mutation of the KHK structural gene is the cause of essential fructosuria was also obtained. In a well-characterized family, in which three of eight siblings have fructosuria, all affected individuals are compound heterozygotes for two mutations Gly40Arg and Ala43Thr. Both mutations result from G-- > A transitions, and each alters the same conserved region of the KHK protein. Neither mutation was seen in a sample of 52 unrelated control individuals. An additional conservative amino acid change (Val49IIe) was present on the KHK allele bearing Ala43Thr \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "19", "end": "40"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "124", "end": "145"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": "173", "end": "200"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "260", "end": "294"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "566", "end": "587"}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1021", "end": "1042"}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": "1132", "end": "1143"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "C538068"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "C538068"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D008661"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "C538068"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "C538068"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "C538068"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "C538068"}]}
