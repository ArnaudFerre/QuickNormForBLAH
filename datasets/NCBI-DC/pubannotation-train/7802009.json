Results in lymphocytes and skin fibroblast cell lines suggest a partial mirror inactivation with the normal X chromosome preferentially active in the unaffected twin, and the maternal deleted X chromosome preferentially active in the affected twin. A review shows that MZ female twins discordant for X-linked diseases are not uncommon. Twinning and X inactivation may be interrelated and could explain the female twins discordant for X-linked traits.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "90", "end": "117"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "246", "end": "249"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "305", "end": "332"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": "821", "end": "838"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D040181"}]}
