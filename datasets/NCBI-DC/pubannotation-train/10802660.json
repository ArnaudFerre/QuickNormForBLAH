{"target": "http://pubannotation.org/docs/sourcedb/PubMed/sourceid/10802660", "sourcedb": "PubMed", "sourceid": "10802660", "text": "De novo deletions of SNRPN exon 1 in early human and mouse embryos result in a paternal to maternal imprint switch.\n\nPrader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurogenetic disease characterized by infantile hypotonia, gonadal hypoplasia, obsessive behaviour and neonatal feeding difficulties followed by hyperphagia, leading to profound obesity. PWS is due to a lack of paternal genetic information at 15q11-q13 (ref. 2). Five imprinted, paternally expressed genes map to the PWS region, MKRN3 (ref. 3), NDN (ref. 4), NDNL1 (ref. 5), SNRPN (refs 6-8) and IPW (ref. 9), as well as two poorly characterized framents designated PAR-1 and PAR-5 (ref. 10). Imprinting of this region involves a bipartite imprinting centre (IC), which overlaps SNRPN (refs 10, 11). Deletion of the SNRPN promoter/exon 1 region (the PWS IC element) appears to impair the establishment of the paternal imprint in the male germ line and leads to PWS. Here we report a PWS family in which the father is mosaic for an IC deletion on his paternal chromosome. The deletion chromosome has acquired a maternal methylation imprint in his somatic cells. We have made identical findings in chimaeric mice generated from two independent embryonic stem (ES) cell lines harbouring a similar deletion. Our studies demonstrate that the PWS IC element is not only required for the establishment of the paternal imprint, but also for its postzygotic maintenance.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "116", "end": "137"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "139", "end": "142"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": "149", "end": "169"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "187", "end": "206"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "208", "end": "226"}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "294", "end": "305"}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "327", "end": "334"}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "336", "end": "339"}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "466", "end": "469"}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "799", "end": "802"}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "910", "end": "913"}}, {"id": "T12", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "932", "end": "935"}}, {"id": "T13", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "1286", "end": "1289"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D020271"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D009123"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D006058"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D006963"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D009765"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T10", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T11", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A12", "subj": "T12", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A13", "subj": "T13", "obj": "D011218"}]}
