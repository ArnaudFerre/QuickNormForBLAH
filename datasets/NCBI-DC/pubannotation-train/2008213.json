The consequent severe diarrhoea and dehydration are usually fatal unless these sugars are eliminated from the diet. Intestinal biopsies of GGM patients have revealed a specific defect in Na (+) -dependent absorption of glucose in the brush border. Normal glucose absorption is mediated by the Na +/glucose cotransporter in the brush border membrane of the intestinal epithelium. Cellular influx is driven by the transmembrane Na + electrochemical potential gradient; thereafter the sugar moves to the blood across the basolateral membrane via the facilitated glucose carrier. We have previously cloned and sequenced a Na +/glucose cotransporter from normal human ileum and shown that this gene, SGLT1, resides on the distal q arm of chromosome 22. We have now amplified SGLT1 complementary DNA and genomic DNA from members of a family affected with GGM by the polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analysis of the amplified products has revealed a single missense mutation in SGLT1 which cosegregates with the GGM phenotype and results in a complete loss of Na (+) -dependent glucose transport in Xenopus oocytes injected with this complementary RNA.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "0", "end": "31"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "85", "end": "116"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "118", "end": "121"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": "129", "end": "156"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "323", "end": "332"}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "337", "end": "348"}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "440", "end": "443"}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1150", "end": "1153"}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "1309", "end": "1312"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "OMIM:606824"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "OMIM:606824"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "OMIM:606824"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D030342"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D003967"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D003681"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "OMIM:606824"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "OMIM:606824"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "OMIM:606824"}]}
