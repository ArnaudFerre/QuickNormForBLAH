The first mutation deletes a large portion of the coding sequence, generating a null allele. The second mutation introduces a missense mutation (C282Y) into the Hfe locus, but otherwise leaves the gene intact. This mutation is identical to the disease-causing mutation in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis. Mice carrying each of the two mutations were bred and analyzed. Homozygosity for either mutation results in postnatal iron loading. The effects of the null mutation are more severe than the effects of the C282Y mutation. Mice heterozygous for either mutation accumulate more iron than normal controls. Interestingly, although liver iron stores are greatly increased, splenic iron is decreased. We conclude that the C282Y mutation does not result in a null allele.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "27", "end": "53"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "155", "end": "170"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "475", "end": "501"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D006432"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D006432"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D006432"}]}
