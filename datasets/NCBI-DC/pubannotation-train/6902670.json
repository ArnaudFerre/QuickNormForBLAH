An association with histocompatibility markers HLA-B18 and HLA-Dw2 was demonstrated, and the slow allotype of factor B was present. Linkage studies in this family suggested a close linkage between the C2 deficiency gene and genes coding for B18, Dw2, and BfS antigens. One HLA-ACB/DBf recombinant was observed showing closer linkage between HLA-D and Bf than between HLA-B and Bf.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "0", "end": "36"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "66", "end": "79"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "99", "end": "134"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "191", "end": "204"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "407", "end": "420"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D008179"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D008179"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}]}
