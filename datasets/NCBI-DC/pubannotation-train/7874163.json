In normal individuals the gene contains between 13 and 36 CAG repeats, whereas most of the clinically diagnosed patients and all of the affected members of a family with the clinical and pathological diagnosis of MJD show expansion of the repeat-number (from 68-79). Southern blot analyses and genomic cloning demonstrates the existence of related genes. These results raise the possibility that similar abnormalities in related genes may give rise to diseases similar to MJD. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "35", "end": "57"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "196", "end": "218"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "220", "end": "223"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "439", "end": "442"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "698", "end": "701"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D017827"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D017827"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D017827"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D017827"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D017827"}]}
