PWS becomes apparent when genes on the paternally inherited chromosome are not expressed. Familial PWS is rare. We report on a family in which a male and a female paternal first cousin both have PWS with cytogenetically normal karyotypes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis shows a submicroscopic deletion of SNRPN, but not the closely associated loci D15S10, D15S11, D15S63, and GABRB3. The cousins fathers and two paternal aunts have the same deletion and are clinically normal. The grandmother of the cousins is deceased and not available for study, and their grandfather is not deleted for SNRPN. DNA methylation analysis of D15S63 is consistent with an abnormality of the imprinting center associated with PWS. \" Grandmatrilineal \" inheritance occurs when a woman with deletion of an imprinted, paternally expressed gene is at risk of having affected grandchildren through her sons. In this case, PWS does not become evident as long as the deletion is passed through the matrilineal line. This represents a unique inheritance pattern due to imprinting.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "40", "end": "61"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "136", "end": "157"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "159", "end": "162"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "219", "end": "222"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "309", "end": "321"}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "414", "end": "417"}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "946", "end": "949"}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1137", "end": "1140"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D011218"}]}
