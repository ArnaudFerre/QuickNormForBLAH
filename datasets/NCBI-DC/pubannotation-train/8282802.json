We investigated the metabolism of the HDL apolipoproteins (apo) apoA-I and apoA-II in a total of five patients with LCAT deficiency, one with classic LCAT deficiency and four with Fish-eye disease. Plasma levels of apoA-II were decreased to a proportionately greater extent (23% of normal) than apoA-I (30% of normal). In addition, plasma concentrations of HDL particles containing both apoA-I and apoA-II (LpA-I  A-II) were much lower (18% of normal) than those of particles containing only apoA-I (LpA-I) (51% of normal). The metabolic basis for the low levels of apoA-II and LpA-I  A-II was investigated in all five patients using both exogenous radiotracer and endogenous stable isotope labeling techniques. The mean plasma residence time of apoA-I was decreased at 2. 08 +/- 0. 27 d (controls 4. 74 +/- 0. 65 days); however, the residence time of apoA-II was even shorter at 1. 66 +/- 0. 24 d (controls 5. 25 +/- 0. 61 d). In addition, the catabolism of apoA-I in LpA-I  A-II was substantially faster than that of apoA-I in LpA-I. In summary, genetic syndromes of either complete or partial LCAT deficiency result in low levels of HDL through preferential hypercatabolism of apoA-II and HDL particles containing apoA-II. Because LpA-I has been proposed to be more protective than LpA-I  A-II against atherosclerosis, this selective effect on the metabolism of LpA-I  A-II may provide a potential explanation why patients with classic LCAT deficiency and Fish-eye disease are not at increased risk for premature atherosclerosis despite markedly decreased levels of HDL cholesterol and apoA-I \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "135", "end": "173"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "178", "end": "194"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": "196", "end": "270"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "275", "end": "291"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "293", "end": "316"}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "469", "end": "507"}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "625", "end": "640"}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "651", "end": "674"}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "689", "end": "705"}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": "1585", "end": "1620"}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1814", "end": "1829"}}, {"id": "T12", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1940", "end": "1963"}}, {"id": "T13", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1968", "end": "1984"}}, {"id": "T14", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "2025", "end": "2040"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D007863"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D007863"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D007863"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D007863"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D007863"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D050197"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D007863"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D007863"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D007863"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T10", "obj": "D007863"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T11", "obj": "D050197"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A12", "subj": "T12", "obj": "D007863"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A13", "subj": "T13", "obj": "D007863"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A14", "subj": "T14", "obj": "D050197"}]}
