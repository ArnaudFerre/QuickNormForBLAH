Expression was found in RNA from normal fetal muscle, adult cardiac and skeletal muscle, and cultured muscle after myoblast fusion. In DMD muscle, expression of this portion of the gene was also revealed by in situ RNA hybridization, particularly in regenerating muscle fibers.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "0", "end": "27"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "110", "end": "137"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "139", "end": "142"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "268", "end": "271"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "408", "end": "411"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D020388"}]}
