In a panel of 65 myotonic dystrophy families from Canada and the Netherlands, a maximum lod score (Zmax) of 22. 8 at a recombination frequency (theta) of 0. 03 was obtained. Tight linkage was also demonstrated for CKMM and the gene for apolipoprotein C2 (ApoC2). This establishes CKMM as a useful marker for myotonic dystrophy \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "0", "end": "18"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "194", "end": "212"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "214", "end": "216"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "236", "end": "254"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "527", "end": "545"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D009223"}]}
