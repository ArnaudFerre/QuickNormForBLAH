To this end, we performed a linkage study with 59 consecutively collected Dutch breast cancer families, including 16 with at least one case of ovarian cancer. We used an intake cut-off of at least three first-degree relatives with breast and/or ovarian cancer at any age. Significant evidence for linkage was found only among the 13 breast cancer families with a mean age at diagnosis of less than 45 years. An unexpectedly low proportion of the breast-ovarian cancer families were estimated to be linked to BRCA1, which could be due to a founder effect in the Dutch population. Given the expected logistical problems in clinical management now that BRCA1 has been identified, we propose an interim period in which only families with a strong positive family history for early onset breast and/or ovarian cancer will be offered BRCA1 mutation testing.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "73", "end": "95"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "142", "end": "155"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "218", "end": "239"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "365", "end": "378"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "428", "end": "442"}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": "516", "end": "544"}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "618", "end": "631"}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "731", "end": "752"}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": "1068", "end": "1096"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D001943"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D001943"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D061325"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D001943"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D010051"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D001943"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D010051"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D001943"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D061325"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D001943"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D010051"}]}
