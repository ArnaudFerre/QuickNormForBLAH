The sibling recurrence risk ratio for the disease is 63 and heritability assessed in twins > 90%. Although MHC genes, including HLA-B27, contribute only 20-50% of the genetic risk for the disease, no non-MHC gene has yet been convincingly demonstrated to influence either susceptibility to the disease or its phenotypic expression. Previous linkage and association studies have suggested the presence of a susceptibility gene for AS close to, or within, the cytochrome P450 2D6 gene (CYP2D6, debrisoquine hydroxylase) located at chromosome 22q13.1. We performed a linkage study of chromosome 22 in 200 families with AS affected sibling-pairs. Association of alleles of the CYP2D6 gene was examined by both case-control and within-family means. For case-control studies, 617 unrelated individuals with AS (361 probands from sibling-pair and parent-case trio families and 256 unrelated non-familial sporadic cases) and 402 healthy ethnically matched controls were employed. For within-family association studies, 361 families including 161 parent-case trios and 200 affected sibling-pair families were employed. Homozygosity for poor metabolizer alleles was found to be associated with AS. Heterozygosity for the most frequent poor metabolizer allele (CYP2D6*4) was not associated with increased susceptibility to AS. Significant within-family association of CYP2D6*4 alleles and AS was demonstrated. Weak linkage was also demonstrated between CYP2D6 and AS. We postulate that altered metabolism of a natural toxin or antigen by the CYP2D6 gene may increase susceptibility to AS. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "60", "end": "82"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "84", "end": "106"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "108", "end": "110"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": "144", "end": "162"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "594", "end": "596"}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "780", "end": "782"}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "965", "end": "967"}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1348", "end": "1350"}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1476", "end": "1478"}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1542", "end": "1544"}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1617", "end": "1619"}}, {"id": "T12", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1738", "end": "1740"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D013167"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D013167"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D013167"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D012216"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D013167"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D013167"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D013167"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D013167"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D013167"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T10", "obj": "D013167"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T11", "obj": "D013167"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A12", "subj": "T12", "obj": "D013167"}]}
