Of the latter, the most prevalent were associated with haplotype 6 (29. 6%), 1 (18. 5%) and 36 (11. 1%), while the normal alleles were preferentially associated with haplotype 1 (20%). Of the 19 different haplotypes observed, 5 have not been described previously. The haplotype distribution differed significantly from that of the Northern European population. Two of the eight polymorphic sites were in association with PKU. No deletions of exon sequences were found in the families analysed.\n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "68", "end": "83"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "215", "end": "230"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "232", "end": "235"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "726", "end": "729"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D010661"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D010661"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D010661"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D010661"}]}
