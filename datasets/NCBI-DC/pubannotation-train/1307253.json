Co-amplification of 11 exons from genomic DNA of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) patients with no deletion or duplication was performed and the samples subjected to multiple SSCP analysis. We report the case of a nonsense mutation in a Duchenne patient identified by this approach. The mutation introduces a termination codon within exon 8 of the dystrophin gene. It is predicted to cause a very premature translational termination accounting for the severe phenotype observed. The patient inherited this mutation from his mother. In addition the analysis revealed 5 polymorphisms useful for internal control.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "293", "end": "331"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "333", "end": "336"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "337", "end": "340"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "497", "end": "505"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T1", "obj": "C537666"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T3", "obj": "C537666"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D020388"}]}
