This report describes a child with clinical features of ALPS without detectable Fas expression on freshly isolated blood leukocytes. Detection of FAS transcripts via real-time quantitative PCR made a severe transcriptional defect unlikely. Sequencing of the FAS gene revealed a 20-nucleotide duplication in the last exon affecting the cytoplasmic signaling domain. The patient was homozygous for this mutation, whereas the consanguineous parents and the siblings were heterozygous. The patient reported here is a human homologue of the Fas-null mouse, inasmuch as she carries an autosomal homozygous mutation in the FAS gene and she shows the severe and accelerated ALPS phenotype. The heterozygous family members did not have the ALPS phenotype, indicating that the disease-causing FAS mutation in this family is autosomal recessive.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "0", "end": "39"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "41", "end": "45"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "120", "end": "159"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "161", "end": "165"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "349", "end": "353"}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "959", "end": "963"}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "1024", "end": "1028"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D056735"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D056735"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D056735"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D056735"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D056735"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D056735"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D056735"}]}
