We report herein the occurrence of three separate phenotypes within a single family with a novel 3-base pair deletion of codon 153 or 154 of the peripherin/RDS gene. DESIGN  Case reports with clinical features, fluorescein angiography, kinetic perimetry, electrophysiological studies, and molecular genetics. SETTING  University medical centers. PATIENTS  A 75-year-old woman, her two daughters (aged 44 and 50 years), and her 49-year-old son were screened for peripherin/RDS mutations because of the presence of multiple phenotypes within the same family. RESULTS  The mother presented at age 63 years with a profoundly abnormal electroretinogram (ERG) and adult-onset retinitis pigmentosa that progressed dramatically over 12 years, with marked loss of peripheral visual field. One daughter developed pattern macular dystrophy at age 31 years. At age 44 years, her ERG was moderately abnormal but her clinical disease was limited to the macula. Another daughter presented at age 42 years with macular degeneration and over 10 years developed the clinical picture of fundus flavimaculatus. Her peripheral visual field was preserved but her ERG was moderately abnormal. The son had onset of macular degeneration at age 44 years. Pericentral scotomas were present and the ERG was markedly abnormal. Fluorescein angiography revealed punctate pigment epithelial transmission defects. CONCLUSIONS  A 3-base pair deletion of codon 153 or 154 of the peripherin/RDS gene can produce clinically disparate phenotypes even within the same family.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "31", "end": "51"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "53", "end": "70"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "76", "end": "97"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "267", "end": "306"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "316", "end": "333"}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "339", "end": "367"}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1039", "end": "1059"}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1172", "end": "1197"}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1364", "end": "1384"}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1437", "end": "1458"}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1560", "end": "1580"}}, {"id": "T12", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1598", "end": "1618"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D012174"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D008268"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "C535804"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D012174"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D008268"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "OMIM:136880"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D012174"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D008268"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D008268"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T10", "obj": "C535804"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T11", "obj": "D008268"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A12", "subj": "T12", "obj": "D012607"}]}
