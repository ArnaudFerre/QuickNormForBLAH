The antibody reacted with the 80 kDa band protein in control fibroblasts, while no bands were detected in the fibroblasts from a patient with ALD (# 163), in which mRNA of the ALD gene was undetectable based on Northern blot analysis. The 293T cells transfected with the full-coding cDNA inserted in the expression vector produced a new 80 kDa protein, as detected by Western blot. In an immunocytological study, the staining was in a punctate pattern, in the normal fibroblasts. However, there was no punctate staining in the # 163 cells. These data thus indicate that the ALD gene encodes an 80 kDa membrane protein.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "0", "end": "20"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "166", "end": "195"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "197", "end": "200"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "250", "end": "253"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "402", "end": "405"}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "436", "end": "439"}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "834", "end": "837"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D000326"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D000326"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D000326"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D000326"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D000326"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D000326"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D000326"}]}
