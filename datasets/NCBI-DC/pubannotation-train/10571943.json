The mutation of intron 9 inducing defective alternative splicing was reported to be responsible for this syndrome. The mutations found in our cases occurred in the same exon of the WT1 gene as detected in Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS) and could not be explained by the previously proposed mechanism. The results suggest that the two syndromes originate from the same WT1 gene abnormality. From a molecular biological point of view, we concluded that the two diseases were not separable, and that FS should be included as an atypical form of DDS.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "100", "end": "116"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "255", "end": "271"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "273", "end": "275"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "483", "end": "503"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "505", "end": "508"}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "642", "end": "662"}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "771", "end": "773"}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "816", "end": "819"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D052159"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D052159"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D052159"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D030321"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D030321"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D009396"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D052159"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D030321"}]}
