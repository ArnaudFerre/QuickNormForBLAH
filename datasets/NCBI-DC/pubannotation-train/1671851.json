The tight linkage to DXS52 could be extended giving a maximal LOD score of 22. 5 at 1 cM. F8C was also tightly linked to ALD with a maximal LOD score of 7. 8 without recombination. Multipoint linkage analysis with the markers DXS304, DXS52, and F8C indicated that both the gene for ALD and for F8C are distal to DXS52. In four patients with ALD, no major structural rearrangement in the Xqter region was observed; in particular, there were no abnormalities in the vision blindness genes. DNA analysis appeared to be of use in determination of the carrier status of females at risk, for the determination of the origin of the mutation in a particular family, and for prenatal diagnosis.\n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "20", "end": "49"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "233", "end": "262"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "264", "end": "267"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "391", "end": "394"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "552", "end": "555"}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "611", "end": "614"}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": "713", "end": "756"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D000326"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D000326"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D000326"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D000326"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D000326"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D000326"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D003117"}]}
