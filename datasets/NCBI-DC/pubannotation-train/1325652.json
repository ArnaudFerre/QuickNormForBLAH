Starting from the MCC gene, a strategy was undertaken to identify constitutional submicroscopic deletions in familial adenomatous polyposis patients that might considerably narrow down the position of the APC gene. To this end, YACs identified by the MCC gene were screened across a chromosome 5-specific cosmid library to provide a source of DNA probes for genomic scanning. The cosmids isolated from these experiments were used to screen a panel of somatic cell hybrids containing chromosome 5 segregated from patients suspected to carry putative interstitial deletions. This screening approach led to the confirmation of a small heterozygous deletion in a polyposis patient that overlaps one of the two isolated YACs. This YAC has been shown to contain the entire APC gene, in addition to a significant portion of DNA flanking the 5 end of the gene, and should therefore prove a valuable resource for functional studies by transfer to colorectal tumor-derived cell lines. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "63", "end": "85"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "226", "end": "246"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "252", "end": "255"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "261", "end": "287"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "450", "end": "480"}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "546", "end": "549"}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "1000", "end": "1009"}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "1108", "end": "1111"}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "1279", "end": "1295"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D011125"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D015179"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D011125"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D011125"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D011125"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D011125"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D011125"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D011125"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D015179"}]}
