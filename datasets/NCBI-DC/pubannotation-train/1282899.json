Identification of each mutant gene provides valuable information as to the type of mutation that occurs spontaneously. We report here a newly identified HPRT mutation in a Japanese patient with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This gene, designated HPRT Tokyo, had a single nucleotide change from G to A, as identified by sequencing cDNA amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. Allele specific oligonucleotide hybridization analysis using amplified genomic DNA showed that the mutant gene was transmitted from the maternal germ line. This mutation would lead to an amino acid substitution of Asp for Gly at the amino acid position 140 located within the putative 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) binding region. Missense mutations in human HPRT deficient patients thus far reported tend to accumulate in this functionally active region. However, a comparison of the data suggested that both missense and synonymous mutations can occur at any coding sequence of the human germ line HPRT gene, but that a limited percentage of all the missense mutations cause disease. The probability that a mutation will cause disease tends to be higher when the missense mutation is within a functionally important sequence.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "173", "end": "184"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "276", "end": "296"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "309", "end": "378"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "643", "end": "663"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "1189", "end": "1203"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D007926"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D007926"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D007926"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D007926"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D007926"}]}
