In this family of disorders, a normally polymorphic CAG repeat becomes expanded, resulting in expression of an expanded polyglutamine domain in the disease gene product. Experimental models of polyglutamine disease implicate the nucleus in pathogenesis; however, the link between intranuclear expression of expanded polyglutamine and neuronal dysfunction remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that ataxin-3, the disease protein in SCA3/MJD, adopts a unique conformation when expressed within the nucleus of transfected cells. The monoclonal antibody 1C2 is known preferentially to bind expanded polyglutamine, but we find that it also binds a fragment of ataxin-3 containing a normal glutamine repeat. In addition, expression of ataxin-3 within the nucleus exposes the glutamine domain of the full-length non-pathological protein, allowing it to bind the monoclonal antibody 1C2. Fractionation and immunochemical experiments indicate that this novel conformation of intranuclear ataxin-3 is not due to proteolysis, suggesting instead that association with nuclear protein (s) alters the structure of full-length ataxin-3 which exposes the polyglutamine domain. This conformationally altered ataxin-3 is bound to the nuclear matrix. The pathological form of ataxin-3 with an expanded polyglutamine domain also associates with the nuclear matrix. These data suggest that an early event in the pathogenesis of SCA3/MJD may be an altered conformation of ataxin-3 within the nucleus that exposes the polyglutamine domain.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "115", "end": "144"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "148", "end": "170"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "172", "end": "176"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "177", "end": "180"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": "201", "end": "233"}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": "435", "end": "456"}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": "576", "end": "596"}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "672", "end": "676"}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "677", "end": "680"}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1648", "end": "1652"}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "1653", "end": "1656"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D017827"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D017827"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D017827"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D017827"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D030342"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D030342"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D009461"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D017827"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D017827"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T10", "obj": "D017827"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T11", "obj": "D017827"}]}
