The hemochromatosis gene, HFE, recently has been identified, and characterization of this gene has shown that it contains two mutations that result in amino acid substitutions-cDNA nucleotides 845 G-- > A (C282Y) and 187 C-- > G (H63D). Although hemochromatosis is common in Caucasians, affecting > = 1/300 individuals of northern European origin, it has not been recognized in other populations. The present study used PCR and restriction-enzyme digestion to analyze the frequency of the 845 G-- > A and 187 C-- > G mutations in HLA-typed samples from non-Caucasian populations, comprising Australian Aboriginal, Chinese, and Pacific Islanders. Results showed that the 845 G-- > A mutation was present in these populations (allele frequency 0. 32%), and, furthermore, it was always seen in conjunction with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians, suggesting that 845 G-- > A may have been introduced into these populations by Caucasian admixture. 187 C-- > G was present at an allele frequency of 2. 68% in the two populations analyzed (Australian Aboriginal and Chinese). In the Australian Aboriginal samples, 187 C-- > G was found to be associated with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians, suggesting that it was introduced by recent admixture. In the Chinese samples analyzed, 187 C-- > G was present in association with a wide variety of HLA haplotypes, showing this mutation to be widespread and likely to predate the more genetically restricted 845 G-- > A mutation.\n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 4, "end": 19}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 95, "end": 112}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 118, "end": 155}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 193, "end": 206}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 211, "end": 226}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 232, "end": 247}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 474, "end": 489}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D006432"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D006432"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D019189"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D019190"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D003643"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D006432"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D006432"}]}
