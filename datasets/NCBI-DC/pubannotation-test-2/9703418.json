We studied the molecular basis of C9 deficiency in four Japanese C9-deficient patients who had suffered from meningococcal meningitis. Direct sequencing of amplified C9 cDNA and DNA revealed a nonsense substitution (CGA-- > TGA) at codon 95 in exon 4 in the four C9-deficient individuals. An allele-specific polymerase chain reaction system designed to detect exclusively only one of the normal and mutant alleles indicated that all the four patients were homozygous for the mutation in exon 4 and that the parents of patient 2 were heterozygous. The common mutation at codon 95 in exon 4 might be responsible for most Japanese C9 deficiency.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 87, "end": 111}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 112, "end": 167}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 192, "end": 213}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 289, "end": 302}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 320, "end": 332}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 364, "end": 388}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 518, "end": 530}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 883, "end": 896}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "OMIM:613825"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "OMIM:613825"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D007153"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "OMIM:613825"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "OMIM:613825"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D008585"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "OMIM:613825"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "OMIM:613825"}]}
