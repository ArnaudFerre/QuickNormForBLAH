Five of the cases were observed in children presenting with idiopathic hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Two of the children exhibited a homozygous deficiency characterized by the absence of the 150-kD form of Factor H and the presence, upon immunoblotting, of the 42-kD Factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1) and other FH-related protein (FHR) bands. Southern blot and PCR analysis of DNA of one patient with homozygous deficiency ruled out the presence of a large deletion of the FH gene as the underlying defect for the deficiency. The other four children presented with heterozygous deficiency and exhibited a normal immunoblotting pattern of proteins of the FH family. Factor H deficiency is the only complement deficiency associated with HUS. These observations suggest a role for FH and/or FH receptors in the pathogenesis of idiopathic HUS.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 36}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 53, "end": 78}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 116, "end": 176}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 205, "end": 224}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 297, "end": 322}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 323, "end": 327}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 892, "end": 911}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 924, "end": 945}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 962, "end": 965}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1062, "end": 1065}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "OMIM:609814"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D006463"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "OMIM:609814"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D007674"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D006463"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D006463"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "OMIM:609814"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D007153"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D006463"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T10", "obj": "D006463"}]}
