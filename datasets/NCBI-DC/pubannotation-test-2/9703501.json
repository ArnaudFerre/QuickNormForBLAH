Association of the BRCA1 protein with the DNA repair protein Rad51 and changes in the phosphorylation and cellular localization of the protein after exposure to DNA-damaging agents are consistent with a role for BRCA1 in DNA repair. Here, it is shown that mouse embryonic stem cells deficient in BRCA1 are defective in the ability to carry out transcription-coupled repair of oxidative DNA damage, and are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and hydrogen peroxide. These results suggest that BRCA1 participates, directly or indirectly, in transcription-coupled repair of oxidative DNA damage.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 78, "end": 103}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 464, "end": 482}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D061325"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "OMIM:604370"}]}
