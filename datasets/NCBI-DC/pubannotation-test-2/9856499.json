All these new molecular defects involve single-nucleotide events, deletions and substitutions, some of which alter splice sites, and others codons. They are distributed along the C7 gene, but predominantly towards the 3 end. All were found in compound heterozygous individuals. The C6/C7 marker haplotypes associated with most C7 defects are tabulated.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 24}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 132, "end": 145}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 488, "end": 498}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "OMIM:610102"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "OMIM:610102"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "OMIM:610102"}]}
