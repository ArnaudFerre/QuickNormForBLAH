The patients father and two brothers also had C6D, but gave no history of meningitis or other neisserial infection. By using exon-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/single-strand conformation polymorphism as a screening step and nucleotide sequencing of target exons, we determined that the proband was a compound heterozygote for two C6 gene mutations. The first, 1195delC located in exon 7, is a novel mutation, while the second, 1936delG in exon 12, has been described before to cause C6D in an unrelated African-American individual. Both mutations result in premature termination codons and C6 null alleles. Allele-specific PCR indicated that the probands two brothers also inherited the 1195delC mutation from their heterozygous mother and the 1936delG mutation from their homozygous father.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 35, "end": 69}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 100, "end": 136}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 137, "end": 141}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 201, "end": 225}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 273, "end": 276}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 301, "end": 311}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 321, "end": 341}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 721, "end": 724}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "OMIM:612446"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "OMIM:612446"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "OMIM:612446"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D008585"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "OMIM:612446"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D008581"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D016870"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "OMIM:612446"}]}
