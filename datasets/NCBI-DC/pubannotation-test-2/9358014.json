Population studies of this polymorphism are facilitated by the fact that the Cys282Tyr mutation creates a Rsal restriction site. We have studied the codon 282 (Cys/Tyr) polymorphism in different ethnic groups. In agreement with previous observations the Tyr allele appeared to be rare or absent in Asiatic (Indian, Chinese) populations. The highest allele frequency (7. 5%) was found in Swedes. Saamis (2%) and Mordvinians (1. 8%) had significantly lower frequencies of the Tyr allele. Comparisons with allele frequencies based on prevalence estimates of HH showed some disagreements with the RFLP data, particularly in Finns. The newly described HFE marker provides a new approach to the screening of HH as well as studies of the relationship between the HFE Tyr allele and different disorders including cancer \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 96, "end": 122}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 123, "end": 126}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 799, "end": 801}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 946, "end": 948}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 1049, "end": 1055}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D006432"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D006432"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D006432"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D006432"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D009369"}]}
