Mutation analysis in 19 families of German, Swiss and Turkish descent by single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing resulted in the detection of seven novel and 10 known mutations. A striking clustering of missense mutations in the first four exons contrasted with a random distribution of nonsense mutations. More than 85% of all known missense mutations were localized in the amino-terminal stretch of the WASP gene product; this region contained a mutational hot spot at codon 86. No genotype-phenotype correlation emerged after a comparison of the identified mutations with the resulting clinical picture for a classical WAS phenotype. A substitution at codon 86 resulted in an extremely variable expression of the disease in a large Swiss family. An extended homology search revealed a distant relationship of this stretch to the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), which is involved in the maintenance of cyto-architecture by interacting with actin-like filaments.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-dev", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "0", "end": "24"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "162", "end": "186"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "259", "end": "262"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": "287", "end": "312"}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "951", "end": "954"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D014923"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D014923"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D014923"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "OMIM:313900"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D014923"}]}
