Using this as immunogen, we prepared a panel of 12 monoclonal antibodies which recognise at least four different epitopes on emerin in order to ensure that emerin can be distinguished from non-specific cross-reacting proteins. All the mAbs recognised a 34 kDa protein in all tissues tested, though minor emerin-related bands were also detected in some tissues. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that emerin is located at the nuclear rim in all tissues examined. A muscle biopsy from an Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EMDM) patient showed complete absence of emerin by both Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, suggesting a simple diagnostic antibody test for EDMD families. Biochemical fractionation of brain and liver tissues showed that emerin was present in nuclei purified by centrifugation through 65% sucrose and was absent from soluble fractions (post-100, 000 g). From these results, together with sequence and structural homologies between emerin, thymopoietins and the nuclear lamina-associated protein, LAP2, we suggest that emerin will prove to be one member of a family of inner nuclear membrane proteins.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-dev", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "4", "end": "37"}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "687", "end": "720"}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "722", "end": "726"}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": "870", "end": "874"}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D020389"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D020389"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D020389"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D020389"}]}
