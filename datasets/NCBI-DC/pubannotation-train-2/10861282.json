{"target": "http://pubannotation.org/docs/sourcedb/PubMed//sourceid/10861282", "sourcedb": "PubMed", "sourceid": "10861282", "text": "Polymorphisms of the CYP2D6 gene increase susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis.\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) is a common and highly familial rheumatic disorder. The sibling recurrence risk ratio for the disease is 63 and heritability assessed in twins > 90%. Although MHC genes, including HLA-B27, contribute only 20-50% of the genetic risk for the disease, no non-MHC gene has yet been convincingly demonstrated to influence either susceptibility to the disease or its phenotypic expression. Previous linkage and association studies have suggested the presence of a susceptibility gene for AS close to, or within, the cytochrome P450 2D6 gene (CYP2D6, debrisoquine hydroxylase) located at chromosome 22q13.1. We performed a linkage study of chromosome 22 in 200 families with AS affected sibling-pairs. Association of alleles of the CYP2D6 gene was examined by both case-control and within-family means. For case-control studies, 617 unrelated individuals with AS (361 probands from sibling-pair and parent-case trio families and 256 unrelated non-familial sporadic cases) and 402 healthy ethnically matched controls were employed. For within-family association studies, 361 families including 161 parent-case trios and 200 affected sibling-pair families were employed. Homozygosity for poor metabolizer alleles was found to be associated with AS. Heterozygosity for the most frequent poor metabolizer allele (CYP2D6*4) was not associated with increased susceptibility to AS. Significant within-family association of CYP2D6*4 alleles and AS was demonstrated. Weak linkage was also demonstrated between CYP2D6 and AS. We postulate that altered metabolism of a natural toxin or antigen by the CYP2D6 gene may increase susceptibility to AS. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 60, "end": 82}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 83, "end": 107}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 108, "end": 111}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 145, "end": 163}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 595, "end": 597}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 781, "end": 783}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 966, "end": 968}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1349, "end": 1351}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1477, "end": 1479}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1543, "end": 1545}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1618, "end": 1620}}, {"id": "T12", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1739, "end": 1741}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D013167"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D013167"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D013167"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D012216"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D013167"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D013167"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D013167"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D013167"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D013167"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A10", "subj": "T10", "obj": "D013167"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A11", "subj": "T11", "obj": "D013167"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A12", "subj": "T12", "obj": "D013167"}]}
