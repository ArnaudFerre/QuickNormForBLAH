Two of the patients, 4-5 month old boys, were found to have a novel disease, VLCAD deficiency, as judged from the results of very low palmitoyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity and the lack of immunoreactivity toward antibody raised to purified VLCAD.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 21, "end": 87}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 436, "end": 452}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "C536353"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "C536353"}]}
