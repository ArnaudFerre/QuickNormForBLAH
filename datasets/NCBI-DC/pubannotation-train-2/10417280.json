At a de novo frequency of approximately. 67-1/10, 000 births, these deletions represent a common structural chromosome change in the human genome. To elucidate the mechanism underlying these events, we characterized the regions that contain two proximal breakpoint clusters and a distal cluster. Novel DNA sequences potentially associated with the breakpoints were positionally cloned from YACs within or near these regions. Analyses of rodent-human somatic-cell hybrids, YAC contigs, and FISH of normal or rearranged chromosomes 15 identified duplicated sequences (the END repeats) at or near the breakpoints. The END-repeat units are derived from large genomic duplications of a novel gene (HERC2), many copies of which are transcriptionally active in germline tissues. One of five PWS/AS patients analyzed to date has an identifiable, rearranged HERC2 transcript derived from the deletion event. We postulate that the END repeats flanking 15q11-q13 mediate homologous recombination resulting in deletion. Furthermore, we propose that active transcription of these repeats in male and female germ cells may facilitate the homologous recombination process. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 27, "end": 62}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 156, "end": 179}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 180, "end": 184}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 190, "end": 207}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 208, "end": 211}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 226, "end": 251}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1160, "end": 1163}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1163, "end": 1166}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D017204"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D017204"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D019954"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D011218"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D017204"}]}
