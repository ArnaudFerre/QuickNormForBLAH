The transversion should not result in an amino acid change in the protein but it does result in the loss of a HaeIII restriction endonuclease cleavage site. It is concordant with the disease in this family. One-hundred-ten unrelated X chromosomes are negative for this mutation. No other sequence defect was found in the PLP exons of the affected males. The cause of disease in this family remains unknown, but the association between this rare mutation and PMD is intriguing. The mutation can serve as a marker for following segregation of the PLP gene.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 77, "end": 105}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 242, "end": 270}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 271, "end": 275}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 736, "end": 739}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D020371"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D020371"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D020371"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D020371"}]}
