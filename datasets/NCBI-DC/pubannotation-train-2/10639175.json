The molecular details of ATM function in the nervous system are unclear, although the neurological lesion in ataxia-telangiectasia becomes apparent early in life, suggesting a developmental origin. The central nervous system (CNS) of Atm-null mice shows a pronounced defect in apoptosis induced by genotoxic stress, suggesting ATM functions to eliminate neurons with excessive genomic damage. Here, we report that the death effector Bax is required for a large proportion of Atm-dependent apoptosis in the developing CNS after ionizing radiation (IR). Although many of the same regions of the CNS in both Bax-/- and Atm-/- mice were radioresistant, mice nullizygous for both Bax and Atm showed additional reduction in IR-induced apoptosis in the CNS. Therefore, although the major IR-induced apoptotic pathway in the CNS requires Atm and Bax, a p53-dependent collateral pathway exists that has both Atm- and Bax-independent branches. Further, Atm- and Bax-dependent apoptosis in the CNS also required caspase-3 activation. These data implicate Bax and caspase-3 as death effectors in neurodegenerative pathways.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 92, "end": 115}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 121, "end": 153}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 182, "end": 203}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 243, "end": 260}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 262, "end": 268}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 270, "end": 284}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 290, "end": 328}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 416, "end": 435}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 439, "end": 460}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D001260"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D030342"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D001260"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D019636"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D009369"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D007154"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D004194"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D019636"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D001260"}]}
