Mutations in the OCRL1 gene have been associated with the disease. OCRL1 encodes a phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-biphosphate (PtdIns [4, 5] P2) 5-phosphatase. We have examined the OCRL1 gene in eight unrelated patients with OCRL and have found seven new mutations and one recurrent in-frame deletion. Among the new mutations, two nonsense mutations (R317X and E558X) and three other frameshift mutations caused premature termination of the protein. A missense mutation, R483G, was located in the highly conserved PtdIns (4, 5) P2 5-phosphatase domain. Finally, one frameshift mutation, 2799delC, modifies the C-terminal part of OCRL1, with an extension of six amino acids. Altogether, 70% of missense mutations are located in exon 15, and 52% of all mutations cluster in exons 11-15. We also identified two new microsatellite markers for the OCRL1 locus, and we detected a germline mosaicism in one family. This observation has direct implications for genetic counseling of Lowe syndrome families.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 58, "end": 71}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 141, "end": 175}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 176, "end": 181}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 189, "end": 206}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 230, "end": 280}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 502, "end": 506}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1252, "end": 1265}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D009800"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D009800"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D009800"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D040181"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D000015"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D009800"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D009800"}]}
