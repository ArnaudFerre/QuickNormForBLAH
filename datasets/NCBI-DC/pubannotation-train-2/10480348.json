Genotype-phenotype studies of mouse models for DMD show position-specific effects of the mutations upon the phenotype  mice with 5 defects of dystrophin have normal ERGs, those with defects in the central region have a normal b-wave amplitude associated with prolonged implicit times for both the b-wave and oscillatory potentials, and mice with 3 defects have a phenotype similar to that seen in  DMD/BMD patients. The mouse studies suggest a key role for the carboxyl terminal dystrophin isoform, Dp260, in retinal electrophysiology. We have undertaken a systematic evaluation of DMD/BMD patients through clinical examination and review of the literature in order to determine whether the position-specific effects of mutations noted in the mouse are present in man. We have found that, in man, a wider variation of DMD defects correlate with reductions in the b-wave amplitude. Individuals with normal ERGs have mutations predominantly located 5 of the transcript initiation site of Dp260. Our results suggest that the most important determinant in the ERG b-wave phenotype is the mutation position, rather than muscle disease severity. Forty-six per cent of patients with mutations 5 of the Dp260 transcript start site have abnormal ERGs, as opposed to 94% with more distal mutations. The human genotype-phenotype correlations are consistent with a role for Dp260 in normal retinal electrophysiology and may also reflect the expression of other C-terminal dystrophin isoforms and their contributions to retinal signal transmission.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 34}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 179, "end": 217}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 218, "end": 222}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 222, "end": 226}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 321, "end": 324}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 671, "end": 675}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 675, "end": 679}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 856, "end": 859}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 859, "end": 863}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 1092, "end": 1103}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1389, "end": 1403}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T4", "obj": "C537666"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T7", "obj": "C537666"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T9", "obj": "C537666"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T10", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A9", "subj": "T11", "obj": "D009135"}]}
