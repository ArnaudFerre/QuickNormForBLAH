BRCA1 mRNA levels are markedly decreased during the transition from carcinoma in situ to invasive cancer. Experimental inhibition of BRCA1 expression with antisense oligonucleotides produced accelerated growth of normal and malignant mammary cells, but had no effect on non-mammary epithelial cells. These studies suggest that BRCA1 may normally serve as a negative regulator of mammary epithelial cell growth whose function is compromised in breast cancer either by direct mutation or alterations in gene expression.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 77, "end": 99}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 154, "end": 188}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 214, "end": 253}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 434, "end": 451}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 455, "end": 470}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 809, "end": 822}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D001943"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D061325"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D001943"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D002278"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D009362"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D001943"}]}
