Previous studies of mutant HPRT proteins analyzed at the molecular level have shown a significant heterogeneity. This investigation further verifies this heterogeneity and identifies insertions, deletions, and point mutations. The direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified product of reverse-transcribed HPRT mRNA enabled the rapid identification of the mutations found in 17 previously uncharacterized cell lines derived from patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 51, "end": 71}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 746, "end": 766}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D007926"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D007926"}]}
