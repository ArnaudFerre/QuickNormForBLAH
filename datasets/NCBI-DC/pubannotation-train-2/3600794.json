To study how mutations in this gene affect muscle development and integrity, it would be of interest to have available a mouse model of the human disease. The mouse mdx mutation affects muscle and confers a mild dystrophic syndrome, but it is not clear whether this mutation is equivalent to Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy in man. Here we describe the use of two sequences from the human Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene that cross-hybridize to mouse X-linked sequences to localize the gene homologous to DMD in the mouse. Both sequences map to the region of 10 centimorgan lying between the Tabby (Ta) and St14-1 (DxPas8) loci, close to the phosphorylase b kinase locus (Phk). By analogy with the human X-chromosome, we conclude that the region in the mouse around the G6pd and St14-1 loci may contain two genes corresponding to distinct human myopathies  Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy which is known to be closely linked to St14-1 in man and the DMD homologue described here.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 45, "end": 72}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 167, "end": 218}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 529, "end": 548}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 609, "end": 643}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 709, "end": 736}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 737, "end": 741}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 832, "end": 835}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 1172, "end": 1182}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 1183, "end": 1217}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 1279, "end": 1282}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D009136"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D020388"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D009135"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T9", "obj": "D020389"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A8", "subj": "T10", "obj": "D020388"}]}
