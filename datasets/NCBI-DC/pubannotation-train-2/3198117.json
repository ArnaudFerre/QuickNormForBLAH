Nine new variants (Gd Kaiping, Gd Boluo, Gd Huiyang, Gd Gaomin, Gd Qing-Baijiang, Gd Gaozhou, Gd Huazhou, Gd Nanhai, and Gd Guangzhou) were identified. Of the 31 variants found in this province, Gd Kaiping, Gd Taiwan-Hakka, Gd Haad Yai, Gd Haad Yai-like and Gd Huiyang occurred most frequently. The frequency of each variant was calculated. The results demonstrated that the genetic heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency was high in this area.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 219, "end": 236}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 688, "end": 703}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D008661"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D005955"}]}
