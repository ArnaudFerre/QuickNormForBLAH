All of them were found in Italian males and all were associated with enzyme deficiency, but only two with signs of haemolysis. These and other variants reported in the literature, which must thus far be regarded as sporadic, are found to map in parts of Italy where common types of G6PD deficiency are also prevalent.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 213, "end": 230}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 259, "end": 269}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 426, "end": 441}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D008661"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D006461"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D005955"}]}
