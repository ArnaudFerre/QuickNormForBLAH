No mutation in the coding region of the proteolipid protein (PLP) gene had been found. The boys maternal aunt came for prenatal diagnosis when 16 + weeks pregnant and carrying a male fetus. Samples were tested for duplication of the PLP gene, by interphase FISH, in lymphocyte preparations from the proband, his aunt and an amniotic fluid cell preparation from the fetus. The proband was found to carry the duplication, thus confirming the diagnosis of Pelizaeus Merzbacher disease, but neither the aunt nor the fetus carried a duplication.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 44, "end": 72}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 124, "end": 152}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 644, "end": 672}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D020371"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D020371"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D020371"}]}
