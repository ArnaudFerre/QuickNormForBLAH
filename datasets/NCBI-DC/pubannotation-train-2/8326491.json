It was found more frequently in subjects of Irish, Scottish, and Welsh origin compared with English origin (63% and 31% respectively). We have now tested, in a blind study, 26 American TSD carriers and 28 non-carriers who have British ancestry for the intron 9 splice site mutation. Six of the carriers and none of the controls were positive for the mutation. All six had Irish ancestry, compared with nine of the 20 other (intron 9 mutation negative) TSD carriers (p < 0. 05). These results confirm the previously found high frequency of the intron 9 mutation in non-Jewish TSD families of British Isles, particularly Irish, origin, and reinforce the need to screen such families for this mutation. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 106, "end": 123}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 194, "end": 211}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 212, "end": 216}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 556, "end": 559}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 823, "end": 826}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 946, "end": 949}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D013661"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D013661"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D013661"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D013661"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D013661"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D013661"}]}
