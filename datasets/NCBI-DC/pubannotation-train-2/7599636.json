Disturbances of enamel formation occur in amelogenesis imperfecta, a clinically heterogenous group of inherited disorders characterised by defective enamel biomineralisation. An amelogenin gene, AMGX, has been mapped to the short of the X chromosome (Xp22. 1-p22. 3) and has been implicated in the molecular pathology of X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta (AIH1). We have identified three families exhibiting AIH1 and screened the AMGX gene for mutations using single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing. Three novel mutations were identified  a C-T substitution in exon 5, and a G-T substitution and single cytosine deletion in exon 6, confirming the existence of extensive allelic heterogeneity in this condition. The identification of family-specific mutations will enable early identification of affected individuals and correlation of clinical phenotype with genotype will facilitate an objective system of disease classification. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 41, "end": 73}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 246, "end": 269}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 306, "end": 325}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 525, "end": 557}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 558, "end": 563}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 611, "end": 615}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "C538243"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D000567"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D030342"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "C538243"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "C538243"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "C538243"}]}
