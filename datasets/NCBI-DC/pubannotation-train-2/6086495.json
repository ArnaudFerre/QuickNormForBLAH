The genes for Becker and Duchenne dystrophies must therefore be closely linked, if not allelic, and any future DNA probes found to be of practical use in one disorder should be equally applicable to the other. The linkage analysis also provides data on the frequency of recombination along the short arm of the X chromosome, and across the centromeric region.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 20, "end": 45}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 147, "end": 172}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 173, "end": 177}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 330, "end": 333}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 421, "end": 452}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "C537666"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "C537666"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "C537666"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "C537666"}]}
