Neither antilymphocytic autoantibodies nor chromosomal abnormalities were found. Serum immunoglobulin levels were within normal limits in his parents and brother who were heterozygous for C2 deficiency. The patients lymphocytes were homozygous at the HLA-D locus but expressed an antigen different from DW2.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 0, "end": 24}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 57, "end": 73}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 87, "end": 100}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 151, "end": 167}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 189, "end": 211}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "DiseaseClass", "span": {"begin": 354, "end": 379}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 499, "end": 512}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D007153"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D007153"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D007153"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "D002869"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T7", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}]}
