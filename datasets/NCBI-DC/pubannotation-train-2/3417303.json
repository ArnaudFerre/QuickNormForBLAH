Synthetic oligonucleotides, designed to discriminate between APOE alleles epsilon 3 and epsilon 4, enabled us to distinguish heterozygous carriers in a hybridization assay. In a subset of families, the relevant segment of the APOE gene was enzymatically amplified to increase the sensitivity of the method. For DM and APOE, a maximum lod score (zmax of 7. 47 was obtained at a recombination frequency (theta) of 0. 047 (male theta = female theta). No recombination (maximum lod score of 5. 61 at theta = 0. 0) was found between APOE and the apolipoprotein CII (APOC2) gene. These results suggest that, in addition to APOC2, APOE is a useful marker for presymptomatic DM diagnosis.\n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 22, "end": 40}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 137, "end": 155}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 156, "end": 159}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 324, "end": 326}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 995, "end": 997}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D009223"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D009223"}]}
