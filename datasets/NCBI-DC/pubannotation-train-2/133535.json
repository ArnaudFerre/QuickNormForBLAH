Family study of a further case.\n\nClose linkage between HL-A and C2 deficiency was first reported by FU and co-workers in 1974. We present here a pedigree of a 31-year-old C2-deficient individual with clinical manifestations of Hodgkins disease. The following markers were tested  C2 levels, factor B polymorphism, blood groups, and enzyme typing. In addition to close linkage between HL-A and C2 deficiency, both parents were heterozygous for Bf (HL-A linked, electrophoretic variation of B). The two HL-A haplotypes closely linked to C2 deficiency are different  2, W18 and W24, W18. They share, however, the SD2 antigen W18 and the LD type 7a.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 20, "end": 33}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 151, "end": 164}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 258, "end": 270}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 314, "end": 330}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 480, "end": 493}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 622, "end": 635}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D006689"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T6", "obj": "OMIM:217000"}]}
