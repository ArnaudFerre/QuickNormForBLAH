To this end, we performed a linkage study with 59 consecutively collected Dutch breast cancer families, including 16 with at least one case of ovarian cancer. We used an intake cut-off of at least three first-degree relatives with breast and/or ovarian cancer at any age. Significant evidence for linkage was found only among the 13 breast cancer families with a mean age at diagnosis of less than 45 years. An unexpectedly low proportion of the breast-ovarian cancer families were estimated to be linked to BRCA1, which could be due to a founder effect in the Dutch population. Given the expected logistical problems in clinical management now that BRCA1 has been identified, we propose an interim period in which only families with a strong positive family history for early onset breast and/or ovarian cancer will be offered BRCA1 mutation testing.. \n", "project": "NCBI-Disease-train", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 73, "end": 95}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 143, "end": 156}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 219, "end": 240}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 366, "end": 379}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "SpecificDisease", "span": {"begin": 429, "end": 443}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 517, "end": 545}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 619, "end": 632}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "Modifier", "span": {"begin": 732, "end": 753}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "CompositeMention", "span": {"begin": 1069, "end": 1097}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "D001943"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "D001943"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A3", "subj": "T3", "obj": "D061325"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A4", "subj": "T4", "obj": "D001943"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A5", "subj": "T5", "obj": "D010051"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A6", "subj": "T7", "obj": "D001943"}, {"pred": "MEDIC", "id": "A7", "subj": "T8", "obj": "D061325"}]}
