They have also been identified as members of the bacterial flora associated with other marine organisms. Here, using a combination of natural products chemistry and genomic analysis, we assess the nature of the siderophores produced by this genus and their potential relationship to phylogeny and lifestyle/ecological niche of this diverse group of organisms. Our analysis shows a wide level of diversity in siderophore based iron uptake systems among this genus with three general strategies: (1) production and utilization of native siderophores in addition to utilization of a variety of exogenous ones, (2) production and utilization of native siderophores only, (3) lack of siderophore production but utilization of exogenous ones. They all share the presence of at least one siderophore-independent iron uptake ABC transport systems of the FbpABC iron metal type and lack the ability for direct transport of ferrous iron. Siderophore production and utilization can be correlated with phylogeny and thus it forms a type of chemotaxonomic marker for this genus.\n\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-dev", "denotations": [{"id": "T9", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 190, "end": 204}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 249, "end": 268}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 319, "end": 334}}, {"id": "T12", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 357, "end": 363}}, {"id": "T13", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 357, "end": 373}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A1", "subj": "T9", "obj": "OBT:002518"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A2", "subj": "T10", "obj": "OBT:000338"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A3", "subj": "T11", "obj": "OBT:000113"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A4", "subj": "T12", "obj": "OBT:000338"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A5", "subj": "T13", "obj": "OBT:000047"}]}
