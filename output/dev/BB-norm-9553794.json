To elucidate the role of the different groups, a storage trial was carried out in which nisin and CO2 were used for the selective inhibition of the two bacterial groups. The shelf-life of vacuum-packed cold-smoked salmon, recorded by sensory evaluation, was four weeks at 5 degrees C and the microflora was composed of LAB (10(6)-10(7) cfu/g) with an associate Gram-negative flora in varying levels (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g). The addition of nisin and/or a CO2-atmosphere increased the shelf-life to five or six weeks and limited the level of LAB to about 10(4)-10(6), 10(3)-10(6) and 10(2)-10(4) cfu/g, respectively. CO2-atmosphere +/- nisin inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria, whereas nisin had no effect on these in vacuum packages. The Gram-negative flora on vacuum-packed salmon was dominated by a Vibrio sp., resembling V. marinus, Enterobacteriaceae (Enterobacter agglomerans, Serratia liquefaciens and Rahnella aquatilis) and occasionally Aeromonas hydrophila. Irrespective of the addition of nisin and/or CO2-atmosphere, the LAB microflora was dominated by Carnobacterium piscicola, which was found to account for 87% of the 255 LAB isolates characterized. Whole-cell-protein patterns analysed by SDS-PAGE confirmed the Carnobacterium species identification. The spoilage potential of C. piscicola isolates was further studied by inoculation of approx. 10(6) cfu/g in cold-smoked salmon stored at 5 degrees C. The salmon did not spoil within 4 weeks of storage in vacuum- or CO2-atmosphere, and it is concluded that despite high levels (> 10(7) cfu/g) of C. piscicola, sensory rejection was caused by autolytic changes. This was supported by the development of soft texture and sour, rancid and bitter off-flavours at the point of spoilage, irrespective of the length of shelf-life and low or high total counts of LAB and Gram-negative bacteria.\n\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-dev", "denotations": [{"id": "T5", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 78, "end": 146}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 151, "end": 161}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 165, "end": 191}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 466, "end": 498}}, {"id": "T12", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 570, "end": 580}}, {"id": "T14", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 639, "end": 658}}, {"id": "T18", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 1003, "end": 1018}}, {"id": "T19", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 1024, "end": 1043}}, {"id": "T21", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 1047, "end": 1067}}, {"id": "T29", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 1318, "end": 1332}}, {"id": "T35", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 1661, "end": 1702}}, {"id": "T36", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 1707, "end": 1713}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 66, "end": 146}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A1", "subj": "T5", "obj": "OBT:000106"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A2", "subj": "T6", "obj": "OBT:000113"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A3", "subj": "T7", "obj": "OBT:002043"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A4", "subj": "T11", "obj": "OBT:002300"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A5", "subj": "T12", "obj": "OBT:000113"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A6", "subj": "T14", "obj": "OBT:000113"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A7", "subj": "T18", "obj": "OBT:000106"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A8", "subj": "T19", "obj": "OBT:000113"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A9", "subj": "T21", "obj": "OBT:002300"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A10", "subj": "T29", "obj": "OBT:000113"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A11", "subj": "T35", "obj": "OBT:002043"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A12", "subj": "T36", "obj": "OBT:003021"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A13", "subj": "T4", "obj": "OBT:000106"}]}
