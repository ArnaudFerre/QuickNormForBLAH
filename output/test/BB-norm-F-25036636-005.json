At the first time point, the community consisted primarily of Proteobacteria, the bacterium Leuconostoc, and the yeast Candida, which can be found at low levels in raw milk ( Quigley et al., 2013). Whereas Candida persisted in the fungal portion of the community, the Proteobacteria were succeeded by Staphylococcus within the first 7 days. As the rinds matured, bacterial taxa Brevibacterium and Brachybacterium and fungal taxa Penicillium and Scopulariopsis\n emerged consistently as a significant fraction of the community (on \naverage, >1% in mature cheeses). Principal coordinate analysis shows a\n reproducible trajectory of all three communities over time ( Figure 7B),\n with the most rapid changes in composition occurring at early time \npoints, which is consistent with previous observations of primary \nsuccession ( Fierer et al., 2012 and Shade et al., 2013).\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 39, "end": 45}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 190, "end": 199}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 325, "end": 333}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 414, "end": 423}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 509, "end": 514}}, {"id": "T16", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 676, "end": 685}}, {"id": "T17", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 707, "end": 721}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "OBT:001480"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A2", "subj": "T2", "obj": "OBT:000113"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A3", "subj": "T6", "obj": "OBT:001276"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A4", "subj": "T8", "obj": "OBT:000113"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A5", "subj": "T11", "obj": "OBT:001481"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A6", "subj": "T16", "obj": "OBT:000113"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A7", "subj": "T17", "obj": "OBT:001480"}]}
