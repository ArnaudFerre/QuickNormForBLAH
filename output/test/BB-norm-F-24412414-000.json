Results demonstrated that all molds were \nsensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (CFS) from \nLAB fermentations (p < 0.05), with growth \ninhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%.\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T11", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 319, "end": 323}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A1", "subj": "T11", "obj": "OBT:000008"}]}
