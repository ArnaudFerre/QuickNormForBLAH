In South Africa, the Xpert MTB/Rif assay and the GenoType MTBDRplus have been implemented into reference laboratories for diagnosis of TB and drug-resistance, but their costs have not been fully elucidated.\nWe conducted a detailed reference laboratory cost analysis of new rapid molecular assays (Xpert and MTBDRplus) for tuberculosis testing and drug-resistance testing in South Africa, and compared with the costs of conventional approaches involving sputum microscopy, liquid mycobacterial culture, and phenotypic drug sensitivity testing.\nFrom a laboratory perspective, Xpert MTB/RIF cost $14.93/sample and the MTBDRplus line probe assay cost $23.46/sample, compared to $16.88/sample using conventional automated liquid culture-based methods. Laboratory costs of Xpert and MTBDRplus were most influenced by cost of consumables (60-80%).\nAt current public sector pricing, Xpert MTB/RIF and MTBDRplus are comparable in cost to mycobacterial culture and conventional drug sensitivity testing. Overall, reference laboratories must balance costs with performance characteristics and the need for rapid results.\n\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T6", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 14, "end": 24}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 436, "end": 448}}, {"id": "T12", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 572, "end": 582}}, {"id": "T14", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 784, "end": 790}}, {"id": "T15", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 803, "end": 831}}, {"id": "T17", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 881, "end": 891}}, {"id": "T19", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 1048, "end": 1062}}, {"id": "T20", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 1078, "end": 1088}}, {"id": "T22", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 1260, "end": 1281}}, {"id": "T24", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 1344, "end": 1356}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A1", "subj": "T6", "obj": "OBT:001169"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A2", "subj": "T10", "obj": "OBT:001169"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A3", "subj": "T12", "obj": "OBT:001169"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A4", "subj": "T14", "obj": "OBT:001335"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A5", "subj": "T15", "obj": "OBT:000500"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A6", "subj": "T17", "obj": "OBT:001169"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A7", "subj": "T19", "obj": "OBT:001030"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A8", "subj": "T20", "obj": "OBT:001169"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A9", "subj": "T22", "obj": "OBT:000500"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A10", "subj": "T24", "obj": "OBT:001169"}]}
