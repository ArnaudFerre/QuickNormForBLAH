It is phagocytosed by immune cells, such as monocytes and macrophages. The precise mechanisms that initiate bacterial uptake have not yet been elucidated. Participation of C3, CR3, class A scavenger receptors and mannose receptor in bacterial uptake have been already reported. However, contribution of an additional, as-yet-unidentified receptor for F. tularensis internalization has been suggested.\nWe show here that cell-surface expressed nucleolin is a receptor for Francisella tularensis Live Vaccine Strain (LVS) and promotes LVS binding and infection of human monocyte-like THP-1 cells. The HB-19 pseudopeptide that binds specifically carboxy-terminal RGG domain of nucleolin inhibits LVS binding and infection of monocyte-like THP-1 cells. In a pull-down assay, elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), a GTP-binding protein involved in protein translation, usually found in cytoplasm, was recovered among LVS bacterial membrane proteins bound on RGG domain of nucleolin. A specific polyclonal murine antibody was raised against recombinant LVS EF-Tu. By fluorescence and electron microscopy experiments, we found that a fraction of EF-Tu could be detected at the bacterial surface. Anti-EF-Tu antibodies reduced LVS binding to monocyte-like THP-1 cells and impaired infection, even in absence of complement and complement receptors. Interaction between EF-Tu and nucleolin was illustrated by two different pull-down assays using recombinant EF-Tu proteins and either RGG domain of nucleolin or cell solubilized nucleolin.\nAltogether, our results demonstrate that the interaction between surface nucleolin and its bacterial ligand EF-Tu plays an important role in Francisella tularensis adhesion and entry process and may therefore facilitate invasion of host tissues. Since phagosomal escape and intra-cytosolic multiplication of LVS in infected monocytes are very similar to those of human pathogenic F. tularensis ssp tularensis, the mechanism of entry into monocyte-like THP-1 cells, involving interaction between EF-Tu and nucleolin, might be similar in the two subspecies. Thus, the use of either nucleolin-specific pseudopeptide HB-19 or recombinant EF-Tu could provide attractive therapeutic approaches for modulating F. tularensis infection.\n\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T6", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 73, "end": 98}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 262, "end": 267}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 311, "end": 323}}, {"id": "T12", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 333, "end": 342}}, {"id": "T13", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 347, "end": 358}}, {"id": "T15", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 708, "end": 712}}, {"id": "T20", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 850, "end": 855}}, {"id": "T21", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 850, "end": 881}}, {"id": "T22", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 856, "end": 881}}, {"id": "T25", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 1010, "end": 1035}}, {"id": "T27", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 1280, "end": 1286}}, {"id": "T31", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 1514, "end": 1539}}, {"id": "T32", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 1781, "end": 1785}}, {"id": "T36", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 2041, "end": 2053}}, {"id": "T38", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 2124, "end": 2142}}, {"id": "T39", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 2172, "end": 2177}}, {"id": "T42", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 2247, "end": 2272}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A1", "subj": "T6", "obj": "OBT:003001"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A2", "subj": "T9", "obj": "OBT:002488"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A3", "subj": "T11", "obj": "OBT:000321"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A4", "subj": "T12", "obj": "OBT:003001"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A5", "subj": "T13", "obj": "OBT:002995"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A6", "subj": "T15", "obj": "OBT:000061"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A7", "subj": "T20", "obj": "OBT:002488"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A8", "subj": "T21", "obj": "OBT:000061"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A9", "subj": "T22", "obj": "OBT:003001"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A10", "subj": "T25", "obj": "OBT:003001"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A11", "subj": "T27", "obj": "OBT:002530"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A12", "subj": "T31", "obj": "OBT:003001"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A13", "subj": "T32", "obj": "OBT:000061"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A14", "subj": "T36", "obj": "OBT:000196"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A15", "subj": "T38", "obj": "OBT:003001"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A16", "subj": "T39", "obj": "OBT:002488"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A17", "subj": "T42", "obj": "OBT:003001"}]}
