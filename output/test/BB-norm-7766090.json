A significantly improved yield of homologous, heterologous and chimeric fusion proteins was observed in E. coli MC1061 and GE864 (a MC4100 derivative) thermoinduced cells. This feature was not detected in other E. coli strains and does not involve a gene dosage mechanism but a strain-dependent stimulation of gene expression unrelated to the RecA protease activity.\n\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T5", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 198, "end": 214}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A1", "subj": "T5", "obj": "OBT:000972"}]}
