The HE method is two-step and takes just 10 minutes, no specialist instruments are required and there is minimal hands-on time. A test method using HE was developed in conjunction with Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) combined with the real-time bioluminescent reporter system known as BART targeting the toxin B gene (tcdB). The HE-LAMP-BART method was evaluated in a pilot study on clinical fecal samples (tcdB(+), n\u200a=\u200a111; tcdB(-), n=\u200a107). The HE-LAMP-BART method showed 95.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity against a gold standard reference method using cytotoxigenic culture and also a silica-based robotic extraction followed by tcdB PCR to control for storage. From sample to result, the HE-LAMP-BART method typically took 50 minutes, whereas the PCR method took >2.5 hours. In a further study (tcdB(+), n\u200a=\u200a47; tcdB(-), n=\u200a28) HE-LAMP-BART was compared to an alternative commercially available LAMP-based method, Illumigene (Meridian Bioscience, OH), and yielded 87.2% sensitivity and 100% specificity for the HE-LAMP-BART method compared to 76.6% and 100%, respectively, for Illumigene against the reference method. A subset of 27 samples (tcdB(+), n\u200a=\u200a25; tcdB(-), n=\u200a2) were further compared between HE-LAMP-BART, Illumigene, GeneXpert (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) and RIDA\u00aeQUICK C. difficile Toxin A/B lateral flow rapid test (R-Biopharm, Darmstadt, Germany) resulting in sensitivities of HE-LAMP-BART 92%, Illumigene 72% GeneXpert 96% and RIDAQuick 76% against the reference method. The HE-LAMP-BART method offers the advantages of molecular based approaches without the cost and complexity usually associated with molecular tests. Further, the rapid time-to-result and simple protocol means the method can be applied away from the centralized laboratory settings.\n\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T4", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 82, "end": 87}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 163, "end": 168}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 650, "end": 658}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 650, "end": 672}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 827, "end": 848}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 2022, "end": 2032}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A1", "subj": "T4", "obj": "OBT:001102"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A2", "subj": "T6", "obj": "OBT:001102"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A3", "subj": "T8", "obj": "OBT:000011"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A4", "subj": "T7", "obj": "OBT:001102"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A5", "subj": "T9", "obj": "OBT:000011"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A6", "subj": "T11", "obj": "OBT:001169"}]}
