This \n3-methylbutanal production clearly correlated with the presence or \nabsence of decarboxylase activity. Again the difference between L. lactis B1157 and B697 is illustrative (Fig. 3),\n with B1157 being decarboxylase-positive and B697 negative.\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [], "attributes": []}
