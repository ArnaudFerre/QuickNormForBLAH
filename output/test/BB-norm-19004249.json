The active compounds inhibited selectively S. aureus. The most active compounds amongst them were those with medium size aliphatic chain and aromatic MAGs with electron withdrawing substituents at the aryl ring. The introduction of one or two-carbon spacer between the aryl ring and the carboxylic function did not influence antibacterial effectiveness.\n\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T4", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 204, "end": 209}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A1", "subj": "T4", "obj": "OBT:002488"}]}
