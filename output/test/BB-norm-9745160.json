The eradication of bismuth-based triple therapy with bismuth subcitrate, metronidazole and amoxicillin is limited by low compliance, drug resistance and side-effects. Two-week proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy has a higher eradication rate but is costly. This study was designed to compare the efficacy, patient compliance and cost of short-term PPI-based triple therapy with those of bismuth-based triple therapy.\nNinety patients with active duodenal ulcer disease and H pylori infection, proven with the 13C-urea breath test and CLO test (Campylobacter-like organism test) were treated randomly in three therapeutic groups: Group A, DeNol 120 mg, amoxicillin 500 mg and metronidazole 250 mg four times a day orally for 14 days; Group B, omeprazole 20 mg plus clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day and amoxicillin 500 mg four times a day for 14 days; Group C, omeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 250 mg and metronidazole 500 mg twice a day for seven days. Nizatidine 150 mg twice a day was given continuously following the end of anti-H pylori therapy for each group. Two months later, endoscopy, the CLO test and 13C-urea breath test were repeated to assess the eradication rate of H pylori and the ulcer-healing rate. Drug tolerance was evaluated by patients themselves by daily recording of any side-effects.\nEighty-four patients completed the entire course of therapy and evaluation for H pylori infection. The H pylori eradication rates in Groups A, B and C were 75% (21/28), 93% (26/28) and 89% (25/28), respectively (p = 0.466). The ulcer healing rate was 86% (24/28) in Group A and 89% (25/28) in Groups B and C (p = 0.764). A total of 74 patients (88%) were free from symptoms at the end of the triple therapy. Symptom relief was faster in patients with PPI-based triple therapy (Groups B and C) (days 3 and 4) than for patients with bismuth-based triple therapy (day 5). The cost of Group C therapy was lower than that for Groups A and B. There were no major side-effects in any of the patients.\nOne-week triple therapy with omeprazole, clarithromycin and metronidazole is highly effected for the eradication of H pylori. A therapeutic regime of one week's duration with lower cost, good compliance and mild side-effects may offer a good choice for treatment of duodenal ulcer associated with H pylori infection in clinical practice.\n\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T6", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 59, "end": 67}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 59, "end": 73}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 165, "end": 173}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 165, "end": 179}}, {"id": "T13", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 546, "end": 553}}, {"id": "T14", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 664, "end": 730}}, {"id": "T16", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 685, "end": 693}}, {"id": "T15", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 685, "end": 699}}, {"id": "T21", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 1436, "end": 1441}}, {"id": "T22", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 1488, "end": 1496}}, {"id": "T23", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 1560, "end": 1568}}, {"id": "T26", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 1776, "end": 1781}}, {"id": "T27", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 1883, "end": 1891}}, {"id": "T28", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 1985, "end": 2023}}, {"id": "T29", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 2065, "end": 2107}}, {"id": "T30", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 2232, "end": 2240}}, {"id": "T32", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 2508, "end": 2516}}, {"id": "T33", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 2508, "end": 2522}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A1", "subj": "T6", "obj": "OBT:001534"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A2", "subj": "T7", "obj": "OBT:001533"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A3", "subj": "T10", "obj": "OBT:001534"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A4", "subj": "T9", "obj": "OBT:001533"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A5", "subj": "T13", "obj": "OBT:003220"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A6", "subj": "T14", "obj": "OBT:003220"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A7", "subj": "T16", "obj": "OBT:001534"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A8", "subj": "T15", "obj": "OBT:001533"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A9", "subj": "T21", "obj": "OBT:001533"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A10", "subj": "T22", "obj": "OBT:003220"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A11", "subj": "T23", "obj": "OBT:003220"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A12", "subj": "T26", "obj": "OBT:001533"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A13", "subj": "T27", "obj": "OBT:003220"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A14", "subj": "T28", "obj": "OBT:003220"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A15", "subj": "T29", "obj": "OBT:003220"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A16", "subj": "T30", "obj": "OBT:003220"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A17", "subj": "T32", "obj": "OBT:001534"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A18", "subj": "T33", "obj": "OBT:001533"}]}
