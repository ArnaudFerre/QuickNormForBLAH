Only two strains were not typable by the available O antisera. K untypable strains were found in 4.8% of isolates from gastroenteritis patients, in 11% from healthy carriers, and in 47% and 46% of isolates, respectively, from water and fish samples. Thirteen serotypes identified in Togo are not considered in the Japanese antigenic scheme. The suitability of the Japanese typing scheme for geographic areas outside of Japan is discussed and its extension is suggested.\n\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T4", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 42, "end": 50}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 210, "end": 218}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 373, "end": 397}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 411, "end": 427}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 480, "end": 485}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 490, "end": 502}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A1", "subj": "T4", "obj": "OBT:003220"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A2", "subj": "T6", "obj": "OBT:003220"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A3", "subj": "T7", "obj": "OBT:003220"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A4", "subj": "T8", "obj": "OBT:001625"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A5", "subj": "T9", "obj": "OBT:001530"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A6", "subj": "T10", "obj": "OBT:002903"}]}
