The transaminase activity was found to be present in \nall microorganisms tested (Fig. 3A). The highest variation was observed in the Lactobacillus genus. L. lactis spp. and Streptococcus thermophilus\n showed the highest specific transaminase activity towards leucine and \ntherefore potentially produce the highest concentrations of \n\u03b1-ketoisocaproic acid, which is the substrate for the formation of \n3-methylbutanal.\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [], "attributes": []}
