In the \npresent study, whole-genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis \nwere used to investigate this strain\u2019s mechanisms to reside in the beer \nniche, with special focus on not only stress and hop resistances but \nalso folate biosynthesis and exopolysaccharide (EPS) production.\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T3", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 95, "end": 112}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 165, "end": 169}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 508, "end": 512}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A1", "subj": "T3", "obj": "OBT:001598"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A2", "subj": "T4", "obj": "OBT:003541"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A3", "subj": "T5", "obj": "OBT:003541"}]}
