Our metagenomic sequencing uncovered previously undescribed mgl sequences with high sequence similarity to various \u03b3-Proteobacteria in cheeses from both Europe and North America ( Table S4B). Several of these previously undescribed mgl sequences belonged to Pseudoalteromonas spp. ( Figures 4C and S4B). We mapped metagenomic reads from three cheeses in which Pseudoalteromonas was abundant to the reference genome of Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis (99.5% pairwise identity,  Table S4C). Additionally, Pseudoalteromonas is known to have many cold-adapted enzymes that function in the polar seawater where this bacterium typically grows ( M\u00e9digue et al., 2005).\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 20, "end": 26}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 304, "end": 311}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 512, "end": 519}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 753, "end": 767}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A1", "subj": "T1", "obj": "OBT:001480"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A2", "subj": "T4", "obj": "OBT:001480"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A3", "subj": "T6", "obj": "OBT:001480"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A4", "subj": "T11", "obj": "OBT:003105"}]}
