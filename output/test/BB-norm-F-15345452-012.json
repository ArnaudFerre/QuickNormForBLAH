Specific detection of this microorganism could be of interest to the dairy industry. We also note that Propionibacterium freudenreichii\n was rapidly identified in Leerdamer cheese by DGGE; this microorganism \nis particularly difficult to cultivate on artificial medium and requires\n an incubation time of at least 7 days. Unexpectedly, we identified Pseudoalteromonas species and Halomonas\n species by sequencing two unassigned bands found in the Epoisses cheese\n profiles. This is the first time that these two salt-tolerant bacterial\n species are found in dairy products; their identification was enabled \nby molecular methods.\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T2", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 217, "end": 231}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 426, "end": 440}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 520, "end": 536}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 608, "end": 625}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 804, "end": 819}}, {"id": "T13", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 915, "end": 929}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A1", "subj": "T2", "obj": "OBT:003479"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A2", "subj": "T5", "obj": "OBT:001988"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A3", "subj": "T7", "obj": "OBT:003478"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A4", "subj": "T8", "obj": "OBT:000007"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A5", "subj": "T11", "obj": "OBT:003503"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A6", "subj": "T13", "obj": "OBT:001208"}]}
