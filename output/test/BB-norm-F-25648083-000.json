The adherence capacity of probiotic bacteria to the GI tract\n is a contributing factor for pathogen exclusion [5] and the cell surface characteristics of probiotic bacteria have been related to these adhesion properties [6-9]. Several members of the genus Lactobacillus\n are capable of producing exopolysaccharides (EPS) which can play an \nessential role in determining the cell surface characteristics [7]. EPS are also involved in the formation of biofilms [10,11], which may improve colonisation and aid survival [12-14].\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T4", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 132, "end": 139}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 282, "end": 290}}, {"id": "T14", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 680, "end": 688}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A1", "subj": "T4", "obj": "OBT:003300"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A2", "subj": "T7", "obj": "OBT:000641"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A3", "subj": "T14", "obj": "OBT:000054"}]}
