Because a two-step enrichment was used, the detection limit for dead S. enterica cells in artificially contaminated ice cream and salami samples was high at 10(7 )CFU (25 g)(-1), eliminating potential false-positive results. When the method was evaluated with a range of 100 naturally contaminated food samples, three positive samples were detected by both the real-time PCR-based method and by the standard microbiological method, according to EN ISO 6579. When the real-time PCR-based method was evaluated alongside the standard microbiological method according to EN ISO 6579 with 36 food samples artificially contaminated at a level of 10(0 )CFU (25 g)(-1), identical results were obtained from both methods.\nThe real-time PCR-based method involving a two-step enrichment produced equivalent results to EN ISO 6579 on the day after sample receipt.\nThe developed method is suitable for rapid detection of S. enterica in food.\n\n", "project": "bionlp-ost-19-BB-norm-test", "denotations": [{"id": "T7", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 36, "end": 40}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 221, "end": 225}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 313, "end": 335}}, {"id": "T11", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 360, "end": 388}}, {"id": "T14", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 607, "end": 642}}, {"id": "T16", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 792, "end": 827}}, {"id": "T17", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 1104, "end": 1142}}, {"id": "T19", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 1440, "end": 1444}}, {"id": "T15", "obj": "Habitat", "span": {"begin": 607, "end": 661}}], "attributes": [{"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A1", "subj": "T7", "obj": "OBT:000008"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A2", "subj": "T9", "obj": "OBT:000008"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A3", "subj": "T10", "obj": "OBT:002449"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A4", "subj": "T11", "obj": "OBT:001800"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A5", "subj": "T14", "obj": "OBT:003249"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A6", "subj": "T16", "obj": "OBT:001729"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A7", "subj": "T17", "obj": "OBT:001729"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A8", "subj": "T19", "obj": "OBT:000008"}, {"pred": "OntoBiotope", "id": "A9", "subj": "T15", "obj": "OBT:003249"}]}
